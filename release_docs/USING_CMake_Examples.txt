The compressed examples file, located in the HDF5 install folder, 
can be built and tested with CMake and the supplied 
HDF518_Examples.cmake file. It is recommended that you copy those
two files to your development location before continuing.

The command line to be used is shown at the top of the file. Also,
the location of the HDF5 installation should be verified and 
changed if necessary.

When executed, the ctest script will save the results to the log file
indicated by the ctest command. If you wish the to see more build
and test information, add "-VV" to the ctest command.
