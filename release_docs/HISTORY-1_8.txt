New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Libtool version number is changed to 8.0.0 because there are API
      changes. See below for details. (AKC - 2013/05/07 HDFFV-8435)
    - Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) uses clang/clang++ as the
      default C and C++ compilers. (AKC - 2013/04/19 HDFFV-8245)
    - CMake minimum is now 2.8.10. (ADB 2013/1/14)
    - A new tool, cmakehdf5, which is a build command script similar to
      buildhdf5 is added and is available in the bin directory.
      (AKC - 2013/01/16 HDFFV-8336)
    
    Library
    -------
    - The library can load filter libraries dynamically during runtime.  Users
      can set the search path through environment variable HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH 
      and call H5Pset_filter to enable a dynamic filter. (SLU - 2013/04/08)
    - Added new API functions H5Dscatter and H5Dgather to scatter data to and
      and gather data from a selection within a memory buffer.
      (NAF - 2013/02/05)
    - The library now supports the data conversion from enumeration to numeric
      (integer and floating-point number) datatypes. See Issue HDFFV-8221.
      (SLU - 2012/10/23)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump: added new option -O or -ddl to output the ddl text to a file. This
      is a complement to the -o or --output option, which redirects the data to
      a file. HDFFV-8229 (ADB - 2013/2/25)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - A new API function, H5DOwrite_chunk.  This function writes a data chunk 
      directly into a file, bypassing hyperslab selection, data conversion, 
      and the filter pipeline.  The user must be careful with the function and
      clearly understand the I/O process of the library. (SLU - 2013/2/11)

    Fortran API
    -----------
    - New API functions added (MSB - 2013/3/23):

      h5odecr_refcount_f, h5oexists_by_name_f, h5oget_comment_f,
      h5oget_comment_by_name_f, h5oincr_refcount_f, h5oopen_by_idx_f, 
      h5oset_comment_f, h5oset_comment_by_name_f, h5oset_comment_by_name_f

      F2003: h5oget_info_f, h5oget_info_by_idx_f, h5ovisit_by_name_f
    

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - SunOS 5.11 (emu) 32-bit and 64-bit with Sun C/C++ 5.12 compiler and
      Sun Fortran 95 8.6 compiler.
    - Visual Studio 2012 w/ Intel Fortran 13 on Windows 7
    - g95 released new version recently and is tested in this release.

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.10
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed Thread-safe configure failure for the AIX platform.
      (AKC - 2013/04/19 HDFFV-8390)
    - Configure will check the result of header searches before searching for
      the library. 
      Fixes HDFFV-8257 (ADB 2013/03/04)
    - HDF does not support building SHARED Fortran libraries on OSX. Added 
      CMake code to check for this condition. 
      Fixes HDFFV-8227 (ADB 2013/03/04)
    - CMake builds on Windows will no longer use legacy naming for libraries. 
      The "dll" tag will no longer be added to the name of *.lib and *.dll.
      The option HDF_LEGACY_NAMING is now OFF by default.
      Fixes HDFFV-8292 (ADB 2013/01/30)

    Library
    -------
    - The library now behaves correctly when performing large I/O operations 
      on Mac OS-X.  Previously, single I/O operations > 2 GB would fail 
      since the Darwin read/write calls cannot handle the number of bytes 
      that their parameter types imply.
      Fixes HDFFV-7975 and HDFFV-8240 (DER 2013/01/07)
    - Fixed a bug in the core VFD that causes failures when opening files 
      > 2 GB.
      Fixes HDFFV-8124 and HDFFV-8158 (DER 2013/01/07)
    - Fixed a bug where unintialized memory was read during variable-length
      type conversion.  This caused segfaults in netCDF.  Fixes HDFFV-8159.
      (DER 2013/03/30)
    - Removed the H5Pset/get_dxpl_multi functions from the library.  The
      intended functionality for them was never fully implemented, and they
      have always been fundamentally broken.  NOTE: This does not affect 
      setting the multi VFD or any expected VFD functionality.  Multi VFD 
      usage remains unchanged.  
      Fixes HDFFV-8296.  (DER 2013/03/30)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Performance
    -------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - h5redeploy is changed to do this by default:
	Installation directories:
	prefix       architecture-independent files.
	exec_prefix  architecture-dependent files, default is <prefix>.
	libdir       libraries, default is <exec_prefix>/lib.
	includedir   header files, default is <prefix/include>.
      This allows users to just change the first line of prefix=<...> and the
      effect will change libdir and includedir too.  (AKC 2013/04/05 HDFFV-8358)
    - h5repack: Fixed failure to convert the layout of a small chunked 
      dataset (size < 1K) to contiguous layout.  HDFFV-8214 (JKM 2013/03/26)
    - h5dump: Fixed displaying compression ratio for unknown or user-defined 
      filters. HDFFV-8344 (XCAO 2013/03/19)
    - h5dump: Changed UNKNOWN_FILTER to USER_DEFINED_FILTER for user defined 
      filter. HDFFV-8346 (XCAO 2013/03/19)
    - h5diff: Fixed to return the correct exit code 1 when the program 
      detects a unique extra attribute. Prior to this fix, h5diff returned 
      exit code 0 indicating the two files are identical.   
      HDFFV-7643 (JKM 2013/02/15)
    - h5dump: Fixed writing nulls to a binary file when exporting a dataset
      with compound string datatype. HDFFV-8169 (ADB 2013/1/31)
    - The following h5stat test case failed in BG/P machines (and potentially
      other machines that display extra output if an MPI task returns with a
      non-zero code.)
        Testing h5stat notexist.h5
      The test script was fixed to ignore the extra output.  HDFFV-8233 
      (AKC - 2012/11/30)
    - h5diff: Improved speed when comparing HDF5 files with lots of
      attributes. Much slower performance was identified with release versions 
      from 1.8.7 to 1.8.10 compared to 1.8.6. (JKM 2012/10/19)

    F90 API
    -------
    - The integer type of the 'offset' argument in h5pset_external_f and
      h5pget_external_f was changed to INTEGER(KIND=OFF_T) to support 8-byte
      integers, matching the C type definition of off_t. (MSB - 2013/3/23)
    - h5fc updated to recognize .f95, .f03 and .f08 file extensions. 

    C++ API
    ------
    - The C++ wrappers DSetMemXferPropList::setMulti/getMulti were removed 
      because the C functions H5Pset/get_dxpl_multi functions are removed 
      from the library. Fixes HDFFV-8296 by DER.  (BMR 2013/03/30)
    - An exception thrown by an internal function was not propagating to the
      test program during stack unwinding, so it couldn't be caught by the
      test, and the program terminated "without an active exception."  It 
      seemed that the problem happened when c_str() was used to generate 
      an equivalent const char* from a std::string and the resulting string 
      was passed to the internal function.  As a work-around, we added a 
      try/catch around the the call to the internal function and when the 
      exception is caught there, it is re-thrown.  Fixes HDFFV-8067.  
      (BMR 2013/03/30)

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Fixed a problem with H5DSget_scale_name including the NULL terminator 
      in the size calculation returned by the function. The API was changed 
      to NOT include the NULL terminator in the size of name returned 
      (MSB- 2013/2/10)

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - None

    Testing
    -------
    - In some Mac systems, testlibinfo.sh failed with this error:
         Check file ../src/.libs/libhdf5.7.dylib
         strings: object: ../src/.libs/libhdf5.7.dylib malformed object \
         (unknown load command 15)
      The strings command of Mac systems inspects library files, and older
      versions of strings may not know newer library formats, resulting
      in errors.  Fixed by sending the library file as stdin to the strings
      command to avoid this problem. (AKC - 2013/03/08 HDFFV-8305)
    - Fixed a typo in the ERROR macro in test/testhdf5.h. It segmentation
      faulted when used before. (AKC - 2013/02/12 HDFFV-8267)

Known Problems
==============

* When building using the Cray compilers on Cray machines, HDF5
  configure mistakenly thinks the compiler is an intel compiler and
  sets the -std=c99 flag which breaks configure on Cray. To build HDF5
  properly on a Cray machine, please consult with the instructions in
  INSTALL_parallel for building on Hopper.
  (MSC - 2013/04/26 - HDFFV-8429)

* The h5dump and h5diff utilities occasionally produce different output
  between Linux and Windows systems. This is caused by lower-level library
  routines that fail to write fill values to the user's buffer when reading
  unallocated chunks from datasets that have a fill value set to
  H5D_FILL_VALUE_DEFAULT. Due to platform differences the return of
  spurious data values has only been encountered on Windows 32-bit systems.
  (Issue HDFFV-8247; JP - 2013/03/27)

* The 5.9 C++ compiler on Sun failed to compile a C++ test ttypes.cpp.  It 
  complains with this message:
      "/home/hdf5/src/H5Vprivate.h", line 130: Error: __func__ is not defined.
  
  The reason is that __func__ is a predefined identifier in C99 standard.  The
  HDF5 C library uses it in H5private.h.  The test ttypes.cpp includes 
  H5private.h (H5Tpkg.h<-H5Fprivate.h<-H5Vprivate.h<-H5private.h).  Sun's 5.9
  C++ compiler doesn't support __func__, thus fails to compile the C++ test.
  But Sun's 5.11 C++ compiler does.  To check whether your Sun C++ compiler 
  knows this identifier, try to compile the following simple C++ program:
      #include<stdio.h>

      int main(void)
      {
          printf("%s\n", __func__);
          return 0;
      }
  (SLU - 2012/11/5)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernel) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)
  This issue is no longer present on Ubuntu 12.10 (3.5.0 kernel) with 
  gcc 4.7.2.

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.
  (SLU - 2010/05/05 - HDFFV-1264)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - A new tool, cmakehdf5, which is a build command script similar to
      buildhdf5 is added and is available in the bin directory.
      (AKC - 2013/01/21)

    Library
    -------
    - Updated to latest autotools and changed all hard *.sh scripts to
      configure managed *.sh.in files. Removed overloading of autotools
      TESTS variable by examples and tests. Renamed configure.in to
      configure.ac. (ADB - 2012/08/23 - HDFFV-8129)
    - The data sieve buffer size was set for all the datasets in the file.  It
      could waste memory if any dataset size is smaller than the sieve buffer
      size.  Now the library picks the smaller one between the dataset size
      and the sieve buffer size from the file access property. See Issue 7934.
      (SLU - 2012/4/11)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Added the H5Pget_mpio_no_collective_cause() function that retrieves 
      reasons why the collective I/O was broken during read/write IO access. 
      (JKM - 2012/08/30 HDFFV-8143)

    - Added H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode_f (MSB - 2012/09/27)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5import: Changed to allow the use of h5dump output as input files to 
      h5import. h5dump must include the "-p" option to print the properties; 
      configuration file is captured output of h5dump. The restrictions are 
      that only one dataset with a simple datatype (integer, floating-point, 
      or string) can be processed. Integers and floating-point imports from 
      h5dump must use the "binary" option for the data file. The string version 
      uses the h5dump "-y --width=1" options to disable the indexing printouts, 
      print single columns, and obviously NOT use the "binary" option. 
      (ADB - 2012/07/19 HDFFV-721)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    Fortran API
    -----------
    - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function (was 1 
      instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
      with other Fortran functions; cleaned debug statements from the code.
      (EIP - 2012/06/23)

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.10
===========================
    Library
    -------
    - The library now behaves correctly when performing large I/O operations on
      Mac OS-X.  Previously, single I/O operations > 2 GB would fail since the
      Darwin read/write calls cannot handle the number of bytes that their
      parameter types imply.
      Fixes HDFFV-7975 and HDFFV-8240 (DER - 07 JAN 2013)
    - Fixed a bug in the core VFD that cause failures when opening files > 2 GB.
      Fixes HDFFV-8124 and HDFFV-8158 (DER - 07 JAN 2013)

    Tools
    -----
    - The following h5stat test case failed in BG/P machines (and potentially
      other machines that display extra output if an MPI task returns with a
      non-zero code.)
        Testing h5stat notexist.h5
      The test script was fixed to ignore the extra output.
      HDFFV-8233 (AKC - 2012/12/17)
    - h5diff: Fixed slowness when comparing HDF5 files with many attributes. 
      Much slower performance was identified with later release version 
      (from 1.8.7 to 1.8.10) compared to 1.8.6. The issue was introduced 
      from fixing an attribute related bug for 1.8.7 release in the past.

    Testing
    -------
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.9
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed configure --enable-production to not use -O optimization for Lion
      and Mountain Lion systems when gcc (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2
      (GCC) 4.2.1) is used.  Somehow the -O optimization will cause some of
      the hard conversion code in test/dt_arith.c to fail. HDFFV-8017.
      (AKC - 2012/10/10)
    - Fixed AIX Fortran compiler flags to use appropriate settings for
      debugging, profiling, and optimization situations. HDFFV-8069. 
      (AKC 2012/09/27)

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a memory leak exposed when inserting/removing a property
      from a property list several times. HDFFV-8022. (MSC 2012/05/18)
    - The file_image test will fail in the "initial file image and callbacks in
      the core VFD" sub-test if the source directory is read-only as the test
      fails to create its test files in the build directory. This has been
      fixed. HDFFV-8009 (AKC - 2012/07/06)
  

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - The MPI-POSIX VFD was updated to include the POSIX and Windows
      correctness features added that had already been added to the other VFDs.
      HDFFV-8058/7845.  (DER 2012/09/17)

    Performance
    -------------
    - Removed program perform/benchpar from the enable-build-all list.  The
      program will be retired or moved to another location.  HDFFV-8156
      (AKC 2012/10/01)
    - Retired program perform/mpi-perf. Its purpose has been incorporated
      into h5perf. (AKC 2012/09/21)

    Tools
    -----
    - h5repack: "h5repack -f NONE file1.h5 out.h5" command failed if
      source file contains chunked dataset and a chunk dim is bigger than 
      the dataset dim. Another issue is that the command changed max dims
      if chunk dim is smaller than the dataset dim. These issue occurred 
      when dataset size is smaller than 64k (compact size limit)  Fixed both.
      HDFFV-8012 (JKM 2012/09/24)
    - h5diff: Fixed the counter in verbose mode (-v, -r) so that it will no 
      longer add together the differences between datasets and the differences 
      between attributes of those datasets. This change makes the output of 
      verbose mode consistent for datasets, groups, and committed datatypes. 
      HDFFV-5919 (JKM 2012/09/10)
    - h5diff: Fixed the incorrect result when comparing attribute data 
      values and the data type has the same class but different sizes.
      HDFFV-7942  (JKM 2012/08/15)
    - h5dump: Replaced single element fwrite with block writes.
      HDFFV-1208 (ADB 2012/08/13)
    - h5diff: Fixed test failure for "make check" due to failure of 
      copying test files when performed in HDF5 source tree. Also applied
      to other tools.  HDFFV-8107 (JKM 2012/08/01)
    - ph5diff: Fixed intermittent hang issue on a certain operation in 
      parallel mode. It was detected by daily test for comparing 
      non-comparable objects, but it could have occurred in other 
      operations depending on machine condition.  HDFFV-8003 (JKM 2012/08/01)
    - h5diff: Fixed the function COPY_TESTFILES_TO_TESTDIR() of testh5diff.sh
      to better report when there is an error in the file copying.
      HDFFV-8105 (AKC 2012/07/22)
    - h5dump: Fixed the sort by name display to maintain correct parent/child
      relationships between ascending/descending order.
      HDFFV-8095 (ADB 2012/07/12)
    - h5dump: Fixed the display by creation order when using option -n 
      (print contents).
      HDFFV-5942 (ADB 2012/07/09)
    - h5dump: Changed to allow H5T_CSET_UTF8 to be displayed in h5dump output. 
      Used technique similar to what was done in h5ls (matches library 
      options).
      HDFFV-7999 (ADB 2012/05/23)
    - h5diff: Fixed the tool so that it will not check and display the status 
      of dangling links without setting the --follow-symlinks option. This 
      also improved performance when comparing lots of external links without 
      the --follow-symlinks option.  
      HDFFV-7998 (JKM 2012/04/26)

    F90 API
    -------
    
    - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function (was 1
      instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
      with other Fortran functions; cleaned debug statements from the code.
      (EIP - 2012/06/23)

    - Fixed a problem writing/reading control characters to a dataset; writing
      a string containing alerts, backspace, carriage_return, form_feed,
      horizontal_tab, vertical_tab, or new_line is now tested and working.
      (MSB - 2012/09/01)

    - Corrected the integer type of H5S_UNLIMITED_F to HSIZE_T (MSB - 2012/09/01)

    - Corrected the number of continuation lines in the src files
      to be less than 32 lines for F95 compliance. (MSB - 2012/10/01)

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------

    - Fixed problem with H5TBdelete_record destroying all data following the 
      deletion of a row. (MSB- 2012/7/26)

    - Fixed H5LTget_attribute_string not closing an object identifier when an 
      error occurs. (MSB- 2012/7/21)

    - Corrected the return type of H5TBAget_fill from herr_t to htri_t to 
      reflect that a return value of 1 indicates that a fill value is 
      present, 0 indicates a fill value is not present, and <0 indicates an 
      error.

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - None

Known Problems
==============
* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernal) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.
  (SLU - 2010/05/05 - HDFFV-1264)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - None
    
    Library
    -------
    - Updated to latest autotools and changed all hard *.sh scripts to
      configure managed *.sh.in files. Removed overloading of autotools
      TESTS variable by examples and tests. Renamed configure.in to
      configure.ac. (ADB - 2012/08/23 - HDFFV-8129)
    - The data sieve buffer size was set for all the datasets in the file.  It
      could waste memory if any dataset size is smaller than the sieve buffer
      size.  Now the library picks the smaller one between the dataset size
      and the sieve buffer size from the file access property. See Issue 7934.
      (SLU - 2012/4/11)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Added the H5Pget_mpio_no_collective_cause() function that retrieves 
      reasons why the collective I/O was broken during read/write IO access. 
      (JKM - 2012/08/30 HDFFV-8143)

    - Added H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode_f (MSB - 2012/09/27)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5import: Changed to allow the use of h5dump output as input files to 
      h5import. h5dump must include the "-p" option to print the properties; 
      configuration file is captured output of h5dump. The restrictions are 
      that only one dataset with a simple datatype (integer, floating-point, 
      or string) can be processed. Integers and floating-point imports from 
      h5dump must use the "binary" option for the data file. The string version 
      uses the h5dump "-y --width=1" options to disable the indexing printouts, 
      print single columns, and obviously NOT use the "binary" option. 
      (ADB - 2012/07/19 HDFFV-721)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    Fortran API
    -----------
    - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function (was 1 
      instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
      with other Fortran functions; cleaned debug statements from the code.
      (EIP - 2012/06/23)

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.9
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed configure --enable-production to not use -O optimization for Lion
      and Mountain Lion systems when gcc (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2
      (GCC) 4.2.1) is used.  Somehow the -O optimization will cause some of
      the hard conversion code in test/dt_arith.c to fail. HDFFV-8017.
      (AKC - 2012/10/10)
    - Fixed AIX Fortran compiler flags to use appropriate settings for
      debugging, profiling, and optimization situations. HDFFV-8069. 
      (AKC 2012/09/27)

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a memory leak exposed when inserting/removing a property
      from a property list several times. HDFFV-8022. (MSC 2012/05/18)
    - The file_image test will fail in the "initial file image and callbacks in
      the core VFD" sub-test if the source directory is read-only as the test
      fails to create its test files in the build directory. This has been
      fixed. HDFFV-8009 (AKC - 2012/07/06)
  

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - The MPI-POSIX VFD was updated to include the POSIX and Windows
      correctness features added that had already been added to the other VFDs.
      HDFFV-8058/7845.  (DER 2012/09/17)

    Performance
    -------------
    - Removed program perform/benchpar from the enable-build-all list.  The
      program will be retired or moved to another location.  HDFFV-8156
      (AKC 2012/10/01)
    - Retired program perform/mpi-perf. Its purpose has been incorporated
      into h5perf. (AKC 2012/09/21)

    Tools
    -----
    - h5repack: "h5repack -f NONE file1.h5 out.h5" command failed if
      source file contains chunked dataset and a chunk dim is bigger than 
      the dataset dim. Another issue is that the command changed max dims
      if chunk dim is smaller than the dataset dim. These issue occurred 
      when dataset size is smaller than 64k (compact size limit)  Fixed both.
      HDFFV-8012 (JKM 2012/09/24)
    - h5diff: Fixed the counter in verbose mode (-v, -r) so that it will no 
      longer add together the differences between datasets and the differences 
      between attributes of those datasets. This change makes the output of 
      verbose mode consistent for datasets, groups, and committed datatypes. 
      HDFFV-5919 (JKM 2012/09/10)
    - h5diff: Fixed the incorrect result when comparing attribute data 
      values and the data type has the same class but different sizes.
      HDFFV-7942  (JKM 2012/08/15)
    - h5dump: Replaced single element fwrite with block writes.
      HDFFV-1208 (ADB 2012/08/13)
    - h5diff: Fixed test failure for "make check" due to failure of 
      copying test files when performed in HDF5 source tree. Also applied
      to other tools.  HDFFV-8107 (JKM 2012/08/01)
    - ph5diff: Fixed intermittent hang issue on a certain operation in 
      parallel mode. It was detected by daily test for comparing 
      non-comparable objects, but it could have occurred in other 
      operations depending on machine condition.  HDFFV-8003 (JKM 2012/08/01)
    - h5diff: Fixed the function COPY_TESTFILES_TO_TESTDIR() of testh5diff.sh
      to better report when there is an error in the file copying.
      HDFFV-8105 (AKC 2012/07/22)
    - h5dump: Fixed the sort by name display to maintain correct parent/child
      relationships between ascending/descending order.
      HDFFV-8095 (ADB 2012/07/12)
    - h5dump: Fixed the display by creation order when using option -n 
      (print contents).
      HDFFV-5942 (ADB 2012/07/09)
    - h5dump: Changed to allow H5T_CSET_UTF8 to be displayed in h5dump output. 
      Used technique similar to what was done in h5ls (matches library 
      options).
      HDFFV-7999 (ADB 2012/05/23)
    - h5diff: Fixed the tool so that it will not check and display the status 
      of dangling links without setting the --follow-symlinks option. This 
      also improved performance when comparing lots of external links without 
      the --follow-symlinks option.  
      HDFFV-7998 (JKM 2012/04/26)

    F90 API
    -------
    
    - Fixed a typo in return value of the nh5dread_f_c function (was 1
      instead of 0 on success); fixed the return value to make it consistent
      with other Fortran functions; cleaned debug statements from the code.
      (EIP - 2012/06/23)

    - Fixed a problem writing/reading control characters to a dataset; writing
      a string containing alerts, backspace, carriage_return, form_feed,
      horizontal_tab, vertical_tab, or new_line is now tested and working.
      (MSB - 2012/09/01)

    - Corrected the integer type of H5S_UNLIMITED_F to HSIZE_T (MSB - 2012/09/01)

    - Corrected the number of continuation lines in the src files
      to be less than 32 lines for F95 compliance. (MSB - 2012/10/01)

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------

    - Fixed problem with H5TBdelete_record destroying all data following the 
      deletion of a row. (MSB- 2012/7/26)

    - Fixed H5LTget_attribute_string not closing an object identifier when an 
      error occurs. (MSB- 2012/7/21)

    - Corrected the return type of H5TBAget_fill from herr_t to htri_t to 
      reflect that a return value of 1 indicates that a fill value is 
      present, 0 indicates a fill value is not present, and <0 indicates an 
      error.

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------

Known Problems
==============
* The following h5stat test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that display extra output if an MPI task returns with a non-zero
  code.)
    Testing h5stat notexist.h5
  
  The test actually runs and passes as expected. It is the extra output from
  the MPI process that causes the test script to fail. This will be fixed
  in the next release.  (AKC - 2012/10/25 - HDFFV-8233)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD with the
  native release 8.2 compilers (4.2.1), but are working with gcc 4.6 from the
  ports (and probably gcc releases after that).
  (QAK - 2012/10/19)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernal) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-8235)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.
  (SLU - 2010/05/05 - HDFFV-1264)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - None
    
    Library
    -------
    - Added new feature to merge committed datatypes when copying objects,
      using new H5O_COPY_MERGE_COMMITTED_DTYPE_FLAG, modified by new API
      routines: H5Padd_merge_committed_dtype_path(),
      H5Pfree_merge_committed_dtype_paths(), H5Pset_mcdt_search_cb() and
      H5Pget_mcdt_search_cb().  (QAK - 2012/03/30)
    - Added new feature which allows working with files in memory in the 
      same ways files are worked with on disk. New API routines include 
      H5Pset_file_image, H5Pget_file_image, H5Pset_file_image_callbacks, 
      H5Pget_file_image_callbacks, H5Fget_file_image, and 
      H5LTopen_file_image. (QAK - 2012/04/17)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Corrected memory allocation error in MPI datatype construction code.
      (QAK - 2012/04/23)
    - Add two new routines to set/get the atomicity parameter in the
      MPI library to perform atomic operations. Some file systems (for
      example PVFS2) do not support atomic updates, so those routines
      would not be supported. (MSC - 2012/03/27 - HDFFV-7961)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5repack: Added ability to set the metadata block size of the output
      file, with the '-M'/'--metadata_block_size' command line parameter.
      (QAK - 2012/03/30)
    - h5stat: Added ability to display a summary of the file space usage for a
      file, with the '-S'/'--summary' command line parameter.  (QAK - 2012/03/28)
    - h5dump: Added capability for "-a" option to show attributes containing "/" 
      by using an escape character. For example, for a dataset "/dset" 
      containing attribute "speed(m/h)", use "h5dump -a "/dset/speed(\/h)" 
      to show the content of the attribute. (PC - 2012/03/12 - HDFFV-7523)
    - h5dump: Added ability to apply command options across multiple files using a
      wildcard in the filename. Unix example; "h5dump -H -d Dataset1 tarr*.h5".
      Cross platform example; "h5dump -H -d Dataset1 tarray1.h5 tarray2.h5 tarray3.h5".
      (ADB - 2012/03/12 - HDFFV-7876).
    - h5dump: Added new option --no-compact-subset. This option will not
      interpret the '[' character as starting the compact form of 
      subsetting. This is useful when the "h5dump error: unable to 
      open dataset "datset_name"" message is output because a dataset
      name contains a '[' character. (ADB - 2012/03/05 - HDFFV-7689).
    - h5repack: Improved performance for big chunked datasets (size > 128MB)
      when used with the layout (-l) or compression (-f) options. 
      Before this change, repacking datasets with chunks with a large first 
      dimension would take extremely long. For example, repacking a dataset 
      with chunk dimensions of 1024x5x1 might take many hours to process 
      while changing a dataset with chunk dimensions set to 1x5x1024 
      might take under an hour. After this change, processing the dataset 
      with chunk dimensions of 1024x5x1 takes about 15 minutes, and processing 
      a dataset with chunk dimensions of 1x5x1024 takes about 14 minutes.
      (JKM - 2012/03/01 - HDFFV-7862) 

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - New API: H5LTpath_valid (Fortran: h5ltpath_valid_f) checks
      if a path is correct, determines if a link resolves to a valid
      object, and checks that the link does not dangle. (MSB - 2012/03/15)

    Fortran API
    -----------

    - Added for the C API the Fortran wrapper:
       h5ocopy_f (MSB - 2012/03/22)

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.8
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed Makefile issue in which "-Wl," was not properly specified
      prior to -rpath when building parallel Fortran libraries with
      an Intel compiler. (MAM - 2012/03/26) 
    - Makefiles generated by other packages using h5cc as the compiler
      no longer error when 'make' is invoked more than once in order
      to 'rebuild' after changes to source. (MAM - 2012/03/26)
    - Added code to display the version information of XL Fortran and C++
      in the summary of configure. (AKC - 2012/02/28 - HDFFV-7793)
    - Updated all CMakeLists.txt files to indicate the minimum CMake version is
      the current standard of 2.8.6 (ADB - 2011/12/05 - HDFFV-7854)

    Library
    -------
    - Windows and STDIO correctness changes have been propagated from the SEC2
      and old Windows drivers to the STDIO VFD.  (DER - 2012/03/30 - HDFFV-7917)
    - Fixed an error that would occur when copying an object with attribute
      creation order tracked and indexed. (NAF - 2012/03/28 - HDFFV-7762)
    - Fixed a bug in H5Ocopy(): When copying an opened object, call the
      object's flush class action to ensure that cached data is flushed so
      that H5Ocopy will get the correct data.  (VC - 2012/03/27 - HDFFV-7853)
    - The istore test will now skip the sparse 50x50x50 test when the VFD does
      not support sparse files on that platform.  The most important platforms
      on which this will be skipped are Windows (NTFS sparse files are not
      supported) and Mac OS-X (HFS sparse files are not supported).  This
      fixes CTest timeout issues on Windows.  (DER - 2012/03/27 - HDFFV-7769)
    - Windows and POSIX correctness changes have been propagated from the SEC2
      VFD to the Core VFD.  This mainly affects file operations on the
      driver's backing store and fixes a problem on Windows where large files
      could not be read. (DER - 2012/03/27 - HDFFV-7916 - HDFFV-7603)
    - When an application tries to write or read many small data chunks and
      runs out of memory, the library had a segmentation fault.  The fix is to
      return the error stack with proper information.
      (SLU - 2012/03/23 - HDFFV-7785)
    - H5Pset_data_transform had a segmentation fault in some cases like x*-100.  
      It works correctly now and handles other cases like 100-x or 2/x.
      (SLU - 2012/03/15 - HDFFV-7922)
    - Fixed rare corruption bugs that could occur when using the new object
      header format. (NAF - 2012/03/15 - HDFFV-7879)
    - Fixed an error that occurred when creating a contiguous dataset with a 
      zero-sized dataspace and space allocation time set to 'early'. 
      (QAK - 2012/03/12)
    - Changed Windows thread creation to use _beginthread() instead of
      CreateThread().  Threads created by the latter can be killed in
      low-memory situations. (DER - 2012/02/10 - HDFFV-7780)
    - Creating a dataset in a read-only file caused a segmentation fault when 
      the file is closed.  It's fixed. The attempt to create a dataset will 
      fail with an error indicating the file is read-only.
      (SLU - 2012/01/25 - HDFFV-7756) 
    - Fixed a segmentation fault that could occur when shrinking a dataset 
      with chunks larger than 1 MB. (NAF - 2011/11/30 - HDFFV-7833)
    - Fixed a bug that could cause H5Oget_info to return the wrong address
      after copying a committed (named) datatype. (NAF - 2011/11/14)
    - The library allowed the conversion of strings between ASCII and UTF8
      We have corrected it to report an error under this situation.
      (SLU - 2011/11/8 - HDFFV-7582)
    - Fixed a segmentation fault when the library tried to shrink the size 
      of a compound datatype through H5Tset_size immediately after the 
      datatype was created. (SLU - 2011/11/4 - HDFFV-7618)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - h5unjam: Fixed a segmentation fault that occurred when h5unjam was used 
      with the -V (show version) option. (JKM - 2012/04/19 - HDFFV-8001)
    - h5repack: Fixed a failure that occurred when repacking the chunk size 
      of a specified chunked dataset with unlimited max dims. 
      (JKM - 2012/04/11 - HDFFV-7993) 
    - h5diff: Fixed a failure when comparing groups. Before the fix, if an 
      object in a group was compared with an object in another group where 
      both had the same name but the object type was different, then h5diff
      would fail. After the fix, h5diff detects such cases as non-comparable
      and displays appropriate error messages. 
      (JKM - 2012/03/28 - HDFFV-7644)
    - h5diff: If unique objects exist only in one file and if h5diff is set to 
      exclude the unique objects with the --exclude-path option, then h5diff 
      might miss excluding some objects. This was fixed to correctly exclude 
      objects. (JKM - 2012/03/20 - HDFFV-7837)
    - h5diff: When two symbolic dangling links are compared with the 
      --follow-symlinks option, the result should be the same. This worked when 
      comparing two files, but didn't work when comparing two objects.
      h5diff now works when comparing two objects.
      (JKM - 2012/03/09 - HDFFV-7835)
    - h5dump: Added the tools library error stack to properly catch error
      information generated within the library. (ADB - 2012/03/12 - HDFFV-7958)
    - h5dump: Changed the process where an open link used to fail. Now dangling 
      links no longer throw error messages. (ADB - 2012/03/12 - HDFFV-7839)
    - h5dump: Refactored code to remove duplicated functions. Split XML 
      functions from DDL functions. Corrected indentation and formatting
      errors. Also fixed subsetting counting overflow (HDFFV-5874). Verified
      all tools call tools_init() in main. The USER_BLOCK data now correctly
      displays within the SUPER_BLOCK info. NOTE: WHITESPACE IN THE OUTPUT
      HAS CHANGED. (ADB - 2012/02/17 - HDFFV-7560)
    - h5diff: Fixed to prevent from displaying error stack message when 
      comparing two dangling symbolic links with the follow-symlinks option.
      (JKM - 2012/01/13 - HDFFV-7836)
    - h5repack: Fixed a memory leak that occurred with the handling of 
      variable length strings in attributes.
      (JKM - 2012/01/10 - HDFFV-7840)
    - h5ls: Fixed a segmentation fault that occurred when accessing region 
      reference data in an attribute. (JKM - 2012/01/06 - HDFFV-7838)

    F90 API
    -------
    - None

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - None

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - h5ltget_attribute_string_f: The h5ltget_attribute_string_f used to return 
      the C NULL character in the returned character buffer. The returned 
      charactor buffer now does not return the C NULL character; the buffer 
      is blank-padded if needed. (MSB - 2012/03/23)

    Compiler versions for each platform are listed in the preceding
    "Platforms Tested" table.


Known Problems
==============
* The h5repacktst test fails on AIX 32-bit because the test uses more
  memory than the default amount. The failure message typically looks like:

    "time: 0551-010 The process was stopped abnormally. Try again."

  This is an issue with the test only and does not represent a problem with
  the library. To allow the test to pass, request more memory when testing
  via appropriate command such as:

    $ env LDR_CNRTL=MAXDATA=0x20000000@DSA make check

  (AKC - 2012/05/09 - HDFFV-8016)

* The file_image test will fail in the "initial file image and callbacks in
  the core VFD" sub-test if the source directory is read-only as the test
  fails to create its test files in the build directory. This will be
  resolved in a future release.
  (AKC - 2012/05/05 - HDFFV-8009)
  
* The dt_arith test reports several errors involving "long double" on
  Mac OS X 10.7 Lion when any level of optimization is enabled. The test does
  not fail in debug mode. This will be addressed in a future release.
  (SLU - 2012/05/08)

* The following h5dump test case fails in BG/P machines (and potentially other
  machines that use a command script to launch executables):

   h5dump --no-compact-subset -d "AHFINDERDIRECT::ah_centroid_t[0] it=0 tl=0"
     tno-subset.h5
  
  This is due to the embedded spaces in the dataset name being interpreted
  by the command script launcher as meta-characters, thus passing three
  arguments to h5dump's -d flag. The command passes if run by hand, just
  not via the test script.
  (AKC - 2012/05/03)

* The ph5diff (parallel h5diff) tool can intermittently hang in parallel mode
  when comparing two HDF5 files that contain objects with the same names but
  with different object types.
  (JKM - 2012/04/27)

* On hopper, the build failed when RUNSERIAL and RUNPARALLEL are set
  to aprun -np X, because the H5lib_settings.c file was not generated
  properly. Not setting those environment variables works, because
  configure was able to automatically detect that it's a Cray system
  and used the proper launch commands when necessary. 
  (MSC - 2012/04/18)

* The data conversion test dt_arith.c fails in "long double" to integer
  conversion on Ubuntu 11.10 (3.0.0.13 kernal) with GCC 4.6.1 if the library
  is built with optimization -O3 or -O2.  The older GCC (4.5) or newer kernal
  (3.2.2 on Fedora) doesn't have the problem.  Users should lower the 
  optimization level (-O1 or -O0) by defining CFLAGS in the command line of 
  "configure" like:

      CFLAGS=-O1 ./configure

  This will overwrite the library's default optimization level.
  (SLU - 2012/02/07 - HDFFV-7829)

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value.
  (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however.
  (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2.
  (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.
  (SLU - 2010/05/05 - HDFFV-1264)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully link
  C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. Read all of
  the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions.
  (ADB - 2009/11/11)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file does not
  exist. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the mode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set.
  (AKC - 2009/08/11 - HDFFV-988)
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO.
  (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ==================================================

  ======== Original tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh =========
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  (AKC - 2008/11/10)
  
* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect to see this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  (AKC - 2008/05/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Added the --enable-fortran2003 flag to enable Fortran2003 support 
      in the HDF5 Fortran library. The flag should be used along with the
      --enable-fortran flag and takes affect only when the Fortran compiler 
      is Fortran2003 compliant. (EIP - 2011/11/14)
    - Added checks for clock_gettime and mach/mach_time.h to both configure and
      CMake.  This will support the move from gettimeofday to clock_gettime's
      monotonic timer in the profiling code in a future release.
      (DER - 2011/10/12)
    
    Library
    -------
    - The Windows VFD code has been removed with the exception of the functions
      which set it (H5Pset_fapl_windows, for example).  Setting the Windows
      VFD now really sets the SEC2 VFD.  The WINDOWS_MAX_BUF and
      WINDOWS_USE_STDIO configuration options and #defines have also been
      removed. NOTE: Since the Windows VFD was a clone of the SEC2 VFD, this
      change should be transparent to users.
      (DER - 2011/10/12 - HDFFV-7740, HDFFV-7744)
    - H5Tcreate now supports the string type (fixed-length and variable-
      length). (SLU - 2011/05/20)
 
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Added new H5Pget_mpio_actual_chunk_opt_mode and
      H5Pget_mpio_actual_io_mode API routines for querying whether/how
      a collective I/O operation completed.  (QAK - 2011/10/12)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - None

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - Added the following Fortran wrappers for the Dimension Scale APIs:
        h5dsset_scale_f
        h5dsattach_scale_f
        h5dsdetach_scale_f
        h5dsis_attached_f
        h5dsis_scale_f
        h5dsset_label_f
        h5dsget_label_f
        h5dsget_scale_name_f
        h5dsget_num_scales_f
      (EIP for SB - 2011/10/13 - HDFFV-3797)

    Fortran API
    -----------
    - The HDF5 Fortran library was enhanced to support the Fortran 2003 standard.
      The following features are available when the HDF5 library is configured
      using the --enable-fortran and --enable-fortran2003 configure flags AND
      if the Fortran compiler is Fortran 2003 compliant:

      - Subroutines overloaded with the C_PTR derived type:
          h5pget_f
          h5pget_fill_value_f
          h5pinsert_f
          h5pregister_f
          h5pset_f
          h5pset_fill_value_f
          h5rcreate_f
          h5rderefrence_f
          h5rget_name_f
          h5rget_obj_type_f
      - Subroutines overloaded with the C_PTR derived type 
        and simplified signatures: 
          h5aread_f
          h5awrite_f
          h5dread_f
          h5dwrite_f
      - New subroutines
          h5dvlen_reclaim_f
          h5literate_by_name_f
          h5literate_f
          h5ovisit_f
          h5tconvert_f
          h5pset_nbit_f
          h5pset_scaleoffset_f
      - Subroutines with additional optional parameters:
          h5pcreate_class_f
      (EIP - 2011/10/14)

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - None

Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.7
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Changed the size of H5_SIZEOF_OFF_T to 4 bytes (was 8) in the VMS
      h5pubconf.h based on the output of a test program.  (DER - 2011/10/12)
    - The Windows and VMS versions of H5pubconf.h were brought into sync with
      the linux/posix version. (DER - 2011/10/12)
    - Fixed a bug in the bin/trace Perl script where API functions
      that take a variable number of arguments were not processed for
      trace statement fixup. (DER - 2011/08/25)
    - The --enable-h5dump-packed-bits configure option has been removed.
      The h5dump code that this option conditionally enabled is now always
      compiled into h5dump. Please refer to the h5dump reference manual for 
      usage of the packed bits feature. (MAM - 2011/06/23 - HDFFV-7592)
    - Configure now uses the same flags and symbols in its tests that are
      used to build the library. (DER - 2011/05/24)

    Library
    -------
    - Corrected the error when copying attributes between files which are using
      different versions of the file format. (QAK - 2011/10/20 - HDFFV-7718)
    - Corrected the error when loading local heaps from the file, which could
      cause the size of the local heap's data block to increase dramatically.
      (QAK - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7767)
    - An application does not need to do H5O_move_msgs_forward() when writing
      attributes. Tests were checked into the performance suite.
      (VC - 2011/10/13 - HDFFV-7640)
    - Fixed a bug that occurred when using H5Ocopy on a committed datatype
      containing an attribute using that committed datatype.
      (NAF - 2011/10/13 - HDFFV-5854)
    - Added generic VFD I/O types to the SEC2 and log VFDs to ensure correct
      I/O sizes (and remove compiler warnings) between Windows and true POSIX
      systems.  (DER - 2011/10/12)
    - Corrected some Windows behavior in the SEC2 and log VFDs.  This mainly
      involved datatype correctness fixes, Windows API call error checks, 
      and adding the volume serial number to the VFD cmp functions.
      (DER - 2011/10/12)
    - Converted post-checks for the appropriate POSIX I/O sizes to pre-checks 
      in order to avoid platform-specific or undefined behavior.  
      (DER - 2011/10/12)
    - #ifdef _WIN32 instances have been changed to #ifdef H5_HAVE_WIN32_API. 
      H5_HAVE_VISUAL_STUDIO checks have been added where necessary. This is in 
      CMake only as configure never sets _WIN32. (ADB - 2011/09/12)
    - CLANG compiler with the options -fcatch-undefined-behavior and -ftrapv
      discovered 3 problems in tests and tools' library:
        1. In dsets.c, left shifting an unsigned int for 32 bits or more
           caused undefined behavior.
        2. In dt_arith.c, the INIT_INTEGER macro definition has an overflow
           when the value is a negative minimal and is being subtracted from one.
        3. In tools/lib/h5tools_str.c, right shifting an int value for 32 bits 
           or more caused undefined behavior.
      All the problems have been corrected. (SLU - 2011/09/02 - HDFFV-7674)
    - H5Epush2() now has the correct trace functionality (this is related to the
      bin/trace Perl script bug noted in the configure section).
      (DER - 2011/08/25)
    - Corrected mismatched function name typo of h5pget_dxpl_mpio_c and
      h5pfill_value_defined_c. (AKC - 2011/08/22 - HDFFV-7641)
    - Corrected an internal error in the library where objects that use committed 
      (named) datatypes and were accessed from two different file IDs could confuse
      the two and cause erroneous failures. (QAK - 2011/07/18 - HDFFV-7638)
    - In v1.6 of the library, there was an EOA for the whole MULTI file saved in the 
      super block.  We took it out in v1.8 of the library because it's meaningless 
      for the MULTI file. v1.8 of the library saves the EOA for the metadata file 
      instead, but this caused a backward compatibility problem.
      A v1.8 library couldn't open the file created with the v1.6 library. We
      fixed the problem by checking the EOA value to detect the file
      created with v1.6 library. (SLU - 2011/06/22) 
    - When a dataset had filters and reading data failed, the error message 
      didn't say which filter wasn't registered. It's fixed now. (SLU - 2011/06/03)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - The Special Collective IO (IO when some processes do not contribute to the
      IO) and the Complex Derived Datatype MPI functionalities are no longer
      conditionally enabled in the library by configure. They are always
      enabled in order to take advantage of performance boosts from these
      behaviors. Older MPI implementations that do not allow for these
      functionalities can no longer by used by HDF5.
      (MAM - 2011/07/08 - HDFFV-7639).

    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff: fixed segfault over non-comparable attribute with different 
      dimention or rank, along with '-c' option to display details.
      (JKM - 2011/10/24 - HDFFV-7770)
    - Fixed h5diff to display all the comparable objects and attributes 
      regardless of detecting non-comparables. (JKM - 2011/09/16 - HDFFV-7693)
    - Fixed h5repack to update the values of references(object and region) of 
      attributes in h5repack for 1) references, 2) arrays of references, 
      3) variable-length references, and 4) compound references. 
      (PC - 2011/09/14 - HDFFV-5932)
    - h5diff: fixed a segfault over a dataset with container types 
      array and variable-length (vlen) along with multiple nested compound types. 
      Example: compound->array->compound, compound->vlen->compound.
      (JKM - 2011/09/01 - HDFFV-7712)
    - h5repack: added macro to handle a failure in H5Dread/write when memory
      allocation failed inside the library. (PC - 2011/08/19)
    - Fixed h5jam to not to allow the specifying of an HDF5 formatted file as 
      an input file for the -u (user block file) option. The original HDF5 file 
      would not be accessible if this behavior was allowed. 
      (JKM - 2011/08/19 - HDFFV-5941)
    - Revised the command help pages of h5jam and h5unjam. The descriptions
      were not up to date and some were missing. 
      (JKM - 2011/08/15 - HDFFV-7515)
    - Fixed h5dump to correct the schema location: 
      <hdf5:HDF5-File 
      xmlns:hdf5="http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/XML/schema/HDF5-File" 
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/XML/schema/HDF5-File 
      http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/XML/schema/HDF5-File.xsd">
      (ADB - 2011/08/10)
    - h5repack: h5repack failed to copy a dataset if the layout is changed 
      from chunked with unlimited dimensions to contiguous.
      (PC - 2011/07/15 - HDFFV-7649)
    - Fixed h5diff: the "--delta" option considers two NaN of the same type 
      are different. This is wrong based on the h5diff description in the 
      Reference Manual. (PC - 2011/07/15 - HDFFV-7656)
    - Fixed h5diff to display an instructive error message and exit with
      an instructive error message when mutually exclusive options 
      (-d, -p and --use-system-epsilon) are used together. 
      (JKM - 2011/07/07 - HDFFV-7600)
    - Fixed h5dump so that it displays the first line of each element in correct
      position for multiple dimention array types. Before this fix, 
      the first line of each element in an array was
      displayed after the last line of previous element without
      moving to the next line (+indentation).
      (JKM - 2011/06/15 - HDFFV-5878)
    - Fixed h5dump so that it will display the correct value for 
      H5T_STD_I8LE datasets on the Blue-gene system (ppc64, linux, Big-Endian, 
      clustering). (AKC & JKM - 2011/05/12 - HDFFV-7594)
    - Fixed h5diff to compare a file to itself correctly. Previously h5diff
      reported either the files were different or not compatible in certain 
      cases even when comparing a file to itself. This fix also improves 
      performance when comparing the same target objects through verifying 
      the object and file addresses before comparing the details 
      in the objects. Examples of details are datasets and attributes. 
      (XCAO & JKM - 2011/05/06 - HDFFV-5928)

    F90 API
    -------
    - Modified the h5open_f and h5close_f subroutines to not to call H5open 
      and H5close correspondingly. While the H5open call just adds overhead, 
      the H5close call called by a Fortran application shuts down the HDF5 
      library. This makes the library inaccessible to the application. 
      (EIP & SB - 2011/10/13 - HDFFV-915)
    - Fixed h5tget_tag_f where the length of the C string was used to 
      repack the C string into the Fortran string. This lead to memory 
      corruption in the calling program. (SB - 2011/07/26)
    - Added defined constants:
        H5T_ORDER_MIXED_F (HDFFV-2767)
        H5Z_SO_FLOAT_DSCALE_F
        H5Z_SO_FLOAT_ESCALE_F
        H5Z_SO_INT_F
        H5Z_SO_INT_MINBITS_DEFAULT_F
        H5O_TYPE_UNKNOWN_F
        H5O_TYPE_GROUP_F
        H5O_TYPE_DATASET_F
        H5O_TYPE_NAMED_DATATYPE_F
        H5O_TYPE_NTYPES_F

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Fixed the H5LTdtype_to_text function.  It had some memory problems when 
      dealing with some complicated data types. (SLU - 2011/10/19 - HDFFV-7701)
    - Fixed H5DSset_label seg faulting when retrieving the length of a 
      dimension label that was not set. (SB - 2011/08/07 - HDFFV-7673)
    - Fixed a dimension scale bug where if you create a dimscale, attach two 
      datasets to it, and then unattach them, you get an error if they are 
      unattached in order, but no error if you unattach them in reverse order. 
      (SB - 2011/06/07 - HDFFV-7605)

    Fortran High-Level APIs:

Known Problems
==============

* The STDIO VFD does not work on some architectures, possibly due to 32/64
  bit or large file issues.  The basic STDIO VFD test is known to fail on
  64-bit SunOS 5.10 on SPARC when built with -m64 and 32-bit OS X/Darwin
  10.7.0.  The STDIO VFD test has been disabled while we investigate and
  a fix should appear in a future release, possibly 1.8.9.
  (DER - 2011/10/14)

* h5diff can report inconsistent results when comparing datasets of enum type
  that contain invalid values.  This is due to how enum types are handled in
  the library and will be addressed in the next release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7527)

* The links test can fail under the stdio VFD due to some issues with external
  links.  This will be investigated and fixed in a future release.
  (DER - 2011/10/14 - HDFFV-7768)

* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 - HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value. (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however. (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2. (AKC - 2011/03/10)

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/
  (NAF - 2011/01/19)

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.
  (SLU - 2010/05/05 - HDFFV-1264)

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  (SLU - 2010/02/02)

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully link
  C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. Read all of
  the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions. (ADB - 2009/11/11)

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.
  (MAM - 2009/11/04)
  
* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file does not
  exist. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the mode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (AKC - 2009/08/11 - HDFFV-988)
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. (CMC - 2009/04/28)

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ==================================================

  ======== Original tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh =========
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  (AKC - 2008/11/10)
  
* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect to see this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  (AKC - 2008/05/28)

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  (SLU - 2005/06/30)

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

- Known Problems


New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Configure now generates Makefiles that build in "silent make mode"
      by default in which compile and link lines are significantly
      simplified for clarity. To override this and view actual compile and
      link lines during building, the --disable-silent-rules flag can be used
      at configure time, or the 'make' command can be followed by V=1, to
      indicate a "verbose" make. (MAM - 2011/4/14).
    - Added mpicc and mpif90 as the default C and Fortran compilers for Linux
      systems when --enable-parallel is specified but no $CC or $FC is defined.
      (AKC - 2011/2/7)
    - Added a new configure option, "--enable-unsupported", which can
      be used to stop configure from preventing the use of unsupported
      configure option combinations, such as c++ in parallel or Fortran
      with threadsafe. Use at your own risk, as it may result in a 
      library that won't compile or run as expected!
      (MAM - 2010/11/17 - Bug 2061)

    Library
    -------
    - The library allows the dimension size of a dataspace to be zero.  In 
      the past, the library would allow this only if the maximal dimension 
      size was unlimited. Now there is no such restriction, but no data 
      can be written to this kind of dataset. (SLU - 2011/4/20)
    - We added two new macros, H5_VERSION_GE and H5_VERSION_LE, to let users
      compare certain version numbers with the library being used. (SLU -
      2011/4/20) 
    - Added ability to cache files opened through external links.  Added new
      public functions H5Pset_elink_file_cache_size(),
      H5Pget_elink_file_cache_size(), and H5Fclear_elink_file_cache().
      (NAF - 2011/02/17)
    - Finished implementing all options for 'log' VFD.  (QAK - 2011/1/25)
    - Removed all old code for Metrowerks compilers, bracketed by
      __MWERKS__). Metrowerks compiler is long gone. (AKC - 2010/11/17) 

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
     - h5diff: Added new "verbose with levels" option, '-vN, --verbose=N'.
       The old '-v, --verbose' option is deprecated but remains available;
       it is exactly equivalent to '-v0, --verbose=0'.
       The new levels 1 ('-v1' or '--verbose=1') and 2 ('-v2' or 
       '--verbose=2') can be specified to view more information regarding 
       attributes differences.  Bug #2121 (JKM 2011/3/23)
     - h5dump: Added new option --enable-error-stack. This option will 
       display error stack information in the output stream. This is 
       useful when the "h5dump: Unable to print data" message is output.
       (ADB - 2011/03/03)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - Fortran LT make datasets routines (H5LTmake_dataset_f, 
      h5ltmake_dataset_int_f, h5ltmake_dataset_float_f, h5ltmake_dataset_double_f) 
      and LT read datasets routines (h5ltread_dataset_f,h5ltread_dataset_int_f,
      h5ltread_dataset_float_f, 5ltread_dataset_double_f) can now handle 
      4-dimensional to 7-dimensional rank datasets. HDFFV-1217 (MSB-2011/4/24/2011)

    F90 API
    -------
     - None

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - Intel V11.1 uses now -O3 optimization in production mode (EIP - 2010/10/08)
             


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.6
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Shared C++ and HL libraries on AIX should now be working correctly.
      Note that Fortran shared libraries are still not working on AIX. 
      (See the Known Problems section, below). (MAM - 2011/4/20)
    - Removed config/ibm-aix6.x. All IBM-AIX settings are in one file,
      ibm-aix. (AKC - 2011/4/14)
    - Shared C libraries are no longer disabled on Mac when Fortran
      is enabled. Shared Fortran libraries are still not supported on Mac,
      so configure will disable them by default, but this is overrideable
      with the new --enable-unsupported configure option. The configure
      summary has been updated to reflect the fact that the shared-ness of 
      the C++/Fortran wrapper libraries may not align with the C library.
      (MAM - 2011/04/11 - HDFFV-4353).

    Library
    -------
    - Changed assertion failure when decoding a compound datatype with no
      fields into a normal error failure.  Also prohibit using this sort
      of datatype for creating an attribute (as is already the case for
      datasets and committed (named) datatypes).  (QAK - 2011/04/15, Jira 
      issue #HDFFV-2766)
    - Tell the VFL flush call that the file will be closing, allowing
      the VFDs to avoid sync'ing the file (particularly valuable in parallel).
      (QAK - 2011/03/09)
    - The datatype handler created with H5Tencode/decode used to have the 
      reference count 0 (zero); it now has the reference count 1 (one).
      (SLU - 2011/2/18)
    - Fixed the definition of H5_HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY on Windows so that
      HDgettimeofday() is defined and works properly.  Bug HDFFV-5931
      (DER - 2011/04/14)
    - Added basic VFD tests for the Windows, STDIO and log VFD tests.

    - Updated h5dump test case script to prevent entire test failure when 
      source directory is read-only. Bug #HDFFV-4342 (JKM 2011/4/12)
    - Fixed h5dump displaying incorrect values for H5T_STD_I8BE type data in
      attribute on Big-Endian machine. H5T_STD_I8BE is unsigned 8bit type,
      so h5dump is supposed to display -2 instead of 254. It worked correctly
      on Little-Endian system , but not on Big-Endian system.  Bug #HDFFV-4358
      (JKM 04/08/2011)
    - Updated some HDF5 tools to standardize the option name as 
      '--enable-error-stack' for printing HDF5 error stack messages. h5ls and 
      h5dump have been updated. For h5ls, this replaces "-e/--errors" option, 
      which is deprecated. For h5dump, this is a new option. Bug #2182 
      (JKM 2011/3/30)
    - Fixed the h5diff --use-system-epsilon option. The formula used in the 
      calculation was changed from ( |a - b| / b ) to ( |a - b| ). 
      This was done to improve performance. Bug #2184 (JKM 2011/3/24)
    - Fixed output for H5T_REFERENCE in h5dump. According to the BNF document
      the output of a H5T_REFERENCE should be followed by the type;
      <reference> ::= H5T_REFERENCE { <ref_type> }
      <ref_type> ::= H5T_STD_REF_OBJECT | H5T_STD_REF_DSETREG
      Previously this was only displayed if the -R option was used.
      Bug #1725 (ADB 2011/3/28)
    - Fixed two h5diff issues. 1) h5diff compared attributes correctly only 
      when two objects had the same number of attributes and the attribute 
      names were identical. 2) h5diff did not display useful information about 
      attribute differences. Bug #2121 (JKM 2011/3/17)
    - Fixed a memory leak in h5diff that occurred when accessing symbolic links 
      with the --follow-symlink option. Bug #2214  (JKM 2011/3/18)
    - Fixed a memory leak in h5diff that occurred when accessing variable length 
      string data. Bug #2216 (JKM 2011/3/18)
    - Fixed and improved the help page for h5ls -a, --address option. 
      Bug #1904 (JKM 2011/3/11)
    - Fixed h5copy to enable copying an object into the same HDF5 file.
      Previously h5copy displayed an error message when the target file 
      was the same as the source file. (XCAO 2011/3/8)
    - Fixed an h5dump problem that caused the tool to skip some data elements 
      in large datasets with a large array datatype on Windows. This issue 
      arose only on Windows due to the different return behavior of the 
      _vsnprintf() function.  Bug #2161 (JKM 2011/3/3)
    - Fixed h5dump which was skipping some array indices in large datasets 
      with a relatively large array datatype. The interval of skipped indices
      varied according to the size of the array. Bug #2092 (JKM 2011/2/15)
    - Fixed h5diff which was segfaulting when comparing compound datasets
      with a combination of fixed-length string datatypes and variable-length
      string datatypes in certain orders. Bug #2089 (JKM 2010/12/28)
    - Improved h5diff performance. 1) Now use HDmemcmp() before comparing two 
      elements. 2) Replace expensive H5Tequals() calls. 3) Retrieve datatype
      information at dataset level, not at each element level for compound 
      datasets. HDFFV-7516 (JKM 2011/4/18) 
    - Fixed h5ls to display nested compound types with curly brackets 
      when -S (--simple) option is used with -l (--label), so it shows  
      which members (in curly brackets) belong to which nested compound type, 
      making the output clearer.  Bug #1979 (JKM 2010/11/09)
    - Fixed h5diff to handle variable-length strings in a compound dataset 
      and variable-length string arrays in a compound dataset correctly.
      Garbage values were previously displayed when h5diff compared multiple 
      variable-length strings in a compound type dataset. 
      Bug #1989 (JKM 2010/10/28)
    - Fixed h5copy to fail gracefully when copying an object to a non-
      existing group without the -p option. Bug #2040 (JKM 2010/10/18)

       length field names.
    -  h5tget_field_info_f: Fixed error with packing the C strings into a Fortran 
       array of strings. Added optional argument called 'maxlen_out' which returns 
       the maximum string character length in a field name element.

Known Problems
==============
* After the shared library support was fixed for some bugs, it was discovered
  that "make prefix=XXX install" no longer works for shared libraries. It
  still works correctly for static libraries. Therefore, if you want to
  install the HDF5 shared libraries in a location such as /usr/local/hdf5,
  you need to specify the location via the --prefix option during configure 
  time. E.g, ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5 ...
  (AKC - 2011/05/07 HDFFV-7583)

* The parallel test, t_shapesame, in testpar/, may run for a long time and may
  be terminated by the alarm signal.  If that happens, one can increase the
  alarm seconds (default is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes) by setting the
  environment variable, $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS, to a larger value such as 3600
  (60 minutes).  Note that the t_shapesame test may fail in some systems 
  (see the "While working on the 1.8.6 release..." problem below).  If 
  it does, it will waste more time if $HDF5_ALARM_SECONDS is set
  to a larger value. (AKC - 2011/05/07)

* The C++ and FORTRAN bindings are not currently working on FreeBSD.
  (QAK - 2011/04/26)

* Shared Fortran libraries are not quite working on AIX. While they are
  generated when --enable-shared is specified, the fortran and hl/fortran
  tests fail. We are looking into the issue. HL and C++ shared libraries
  should now be working as intended, however. (MAM - 2011/04/20)

* The --with-mpe configure option does not work with Mpich2. AKC - 2011/03/10

* If parallel gmake (e.g., gmake -j 4) is used, the "gmake clean" command
  sometimes fails in the perform directory due to the attempt to remove the
  executable of h5perf or h5perf_serial by two "parallel" commands. This error
  has no consequence on the functionality of the HDF5 library or install. It
  is fixed in the next release. AKC - 2011/01/25

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or file systems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/

* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.  Please see bug #1813.
  SLU - 2010/5/5 

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added in.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug in 1.8 library.  Because there's only one user 
  complaining about it, we (Elena, Quincey, and I) decided to leave it as 
  it is (see bug report #1279).  Quincey will make a plan for 1.10.
  SLU - 2010/2/2

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully link
  C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. Read all of
  the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions. ADB - 2009/11/11
  
* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file does not
  exist. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the mode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ==================================================

  ======== Original tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh =========
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename

  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  H5LSTEST $FILEOUT

  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect to see this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On cobalt, an SGI Altix SMP ia64 system, Intel compiler version 10.1 (which
  is the default on that system) does not work properly and results in
  failures during make check (in a static build) and make installcheck (during
  a shared build). This appears to be a compiler optimization problem.
  Reducing optimization by setting CFLAGS to -O1 or below resolves the issue.
  Alternatively, using a newer version of the compiler (11.0) also works as
  intended. MAM - 2010/06/01

* h5diff will not report enum value differences when one or both of the values
  is not a valid enumeration value.  The source of this bug has been identified
  and it will be fixed in 1.8.8. DER - 2011/04/27

- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.5
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake: Improved CPack packaging, added parallel commands, improved
      configuration options (better similarity to configure), added more
      tests, better support for use in external cmake projects. 
      (ADB - 2010/10/07)
    - The default configuration setting for official releases is 
      --enable-production. For unofficial releases, the default configuration 
      setting has been --disable-production. (AKC  - 2010/05/28)
    Library
    -------
    - Added support for thread safety on Windows using the Windows threads 
      library. Use the HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE option in CMake on a Windows 
      platform to enable this functionality. This is supported on Windows 
      Vista and newer Windows operating systems. (MAM - 2010/09/10)
    - H5Tset_order and H5Tget_order now support all datatypes.  A new byte 
      order, H5T_ORDER_MIXED, has been added specifically for a compound 
      datatype and its derived type.  (SLU - 2010/8/23) 
    - Improved performance of metadata I/O by changing the default algorithm 
      to perform I/O from all processes (instead of just process 0) when using 
      parallel I/O drivers. (QAK - 2010/07/19)
    - Improved performance of I/O on datasets with the same shape, but 
      different rank. (QAK - 2010/07/19)
    - Improved performance of the chunk cache by avoiding unnecessary b-tree 
      lookups of chunks already in cache. (NAF - 2010/06/15) 
      
    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff: Added a new flag: --exclude-path.  The specified path to an 
      object will be excluded when comparing two files or two groups. If a 
      group is specified to be excluded, all member objects of that group 
      will be excluded.  (JKM - 2010/09/16).
    - h5ls: Added a new flag: --no-dangling-links.  See --help output for 
      details. (JKM - 2010/06/15)
    - h5ls: Added a new flag --follow-symlinks.  See --help output for 
      details. (JKM - 2010/05/25)
      
    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    F90 API
    -------
     - None

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - Sun C and C++ 5.10 and Sun Fortran 95 8.4.
    - Mac OS X 10.6.4 with gcc 4.2.1 and gfortran 4.6


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.5
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - The default number of MPI processes for testing purposes has been 
      changed from 3 to 6.  (AKC - 2010/11/11)
    - Some tests in tools/h5repack may fail in AIX systems when -q32 mode is 
      used. The error is caused by not requesting enough memory in default.
      Added "env LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x20000000@DSA" into the $RUNSERIAL and
      $RUNPARALLE in the AIX config file so that executables are tested with
      more memory.  (AKC - 2010/11/11)
    - Removed recognition of the parallel compilers of LAM(hcc) and
      ChMPIon(cmpicc) since we have no access to these two MPI implementations
      and cannot verify their correctness. (AKC - 2010/07/14 - Bug 1921)
    - PHDF5 was changed to use "mpiexec" instead of mpirun as the default 
      MPI applications startup command as defined in the MPI-2 definition, 
      section 4.1. (AKC - 2010/06/11 - Bug 1921)
      
    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a bug that caused big endian machines to generate corrupt files
      when using the scale-offset filter with floating point data or fill
      values.  Note that such datasets will no longer be readable by any
      by any machine after this patch.  (NAF - 2010/02/02 - Bug 2131)
    - Retrieving a link's name by index in the case where the link is external
      and the file that the link refers to doesn't exist will now fail 
      gracefully rather than cause a segmentation fault. (MAM - 2010/11/17)
    - Modified metadata accumulator to better track accumulated dirty metadata 
      in an effort to reduce unnecessary I/O in certain situations and to 
      fix some other corner cases which were prone to error. (MAM - 2010/10/15)
    - Added a new set of unit tests that are run during 'make check' to verify 
      the behavior of the metadata accumulator. (MAM - 2010/10/15)
    - Modified library to always cache symbol table information.  Libraries
      from version 1.6.3 and earler have a bug which causes them to require 
      this information for some operations. (NAF - 2010/09/21 - Bug 1864)
    - Fixed a bug where the library could generate an assertion/core dump when
      a file that had been created with H5Pset_libver_bounds(fapl,
      H5F_LIBVER_LATEST, H5F_LIBVER_LATEST) but didn't have a superblock
      extension was later reopened.  (QAK - 2010/09/16 - Bug 1968)
    - Fixed a bug that could occur when getting information for a new-style
      group that was previously opened through a file handle that was later
      closed. (NAF - 2010/09/15)
    - Added define check in H5public.h if stdint.h is supported by the C++
      compiler. This define is only available on Windows with VS2010 and using
      CMake to build the library. (ADB - 2010/09/13 - Bug 1938)
    - When a mandatory filter failed to write data chunks, the dataset
      couldn't close (bug 1260).  The fix releases all resources and closes
      the dataset but returns a failure. (SLU - 2010/09/08) 
    - H5Eset_current_stack now also closes the error stack set as the 
      default. This is to avoid a potential problem. 
      (SLU - 2010/09/07 - Bug 1799)
    - Corrected situation where 1-D chunked dataset could get created by an
      application without calling H5Pset_chunk().  H5Pset_chunk is now
      required for creating all chunked datasets.  (QAK - 2010/09/02)
    - Fixed many memory issues that valgrind exposed.  (QAK - 2010/08/24)
    - Fixed the bug in the filter's public CAN_APPLY function.  The return
      value should be htri_t not herr_t. (SLU - 2010/08/05 - Bug 1239)
    - Fixed the STDIO VFD to use fseeko64 instead of fseek64 for 64-bit I/O 
      support. (AKC - 2010/7/30)
    - Fixed a bug in the direct I/O driver that could render files with certain
      kinds of unaligned data unreadable or corrupt them. (NAF - 2010/07/28)
    - valgrind reported an error of copying data to itself when a new attribute 
      is written.  Fixed by taking out the memcpy step in the attribute code. 
      (SLU - 2010/07/28 - Bug 1956)
    - Corrected various issues in the MPI datatype creation code which could
      cause resource leaks or incorrect behavior (and may improve the
      performance as well).  (QAK - 2010/07/19)
    - Fixed a bug that could cause file corruption when using non-default sizes
      of addresses and/or lengths.  This bug could also cause uncorrupted files
      with this property to be unreadable.  This bug was introduced in 1.8.5.
      (NAF - 2010/07/16 - Bug 1951)

    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed h5diff to compare member objects and groups recursively when 
      two files or groups are compared. (JKM - 2010/9/16 - Bug 1975)
    - Fixed h5repack to be able to convert a dataset to COMPACT layout.
      (JKM - 2010/09/15 - Bug 1896)
    - Changed h5ls to not interpret special characters in object or attribute
      names for output. (JKM - 2010/06/28 - Bug 1784)
    - Revised the order of arguments for h5cc, h5fc, h5c++, h5pcc and h5pfc. 
      CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS have been duplicated with an H5BLD_ 
      prefix to put the flags and paths from the hdf5 build in the correct 
      places and allow the script user to add entries in CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS, 
      LDFLAGS, and LIBS that will take precedence over those from the hdf5 
      build. The user can make these entries persistent by editing 
      CFLAGSBASE, CPPFLAGSBASE, LDFLAGSBASE, and LIBSBASE near the top of 
      the script or temporary by setting HDF5_CFLAGS, HDF5_CPPFLAGS, 
      HDF5_LDFLAGS, or HDF5_LIBS in the environment. The new order of 
      arguments in these scripts is $CLINKER $H5BLD_CPPFLAGS $CPPFLAGS 
      $H5BLD_CFLAGS $CFLAGS $LDFLAGS $clibpath $link_objs $LIBS $link_args 
      $shared_link. (LRK - 2010/10/25 - Bug 1973)

Known Problems
==============
* examples/run-all-ex.sh does not work on Cygwin. (NAF - 2011/02/11)

* Parallel test, t_shapesame in testpar, is rather unstable as it continues to
  have occasional errors in AIX and quite often in NCSA Abe. It is being built
  but it is not run automatically in the "make check" command. One would have to
  run it by hand to see if it works in a particular machine. AKC - 2011/01/28

* Although OpenVMS Alpha is supported, there are several problems with the C
  test suite - getname.c, lheap.c, lheap.c, mtime.c, and stab.c.  The test
  suite for h5diff also fails.  These failures are from the tests, not the
  library.  We have fixed these failures.  But it's too late to put the fixes
  into this release.  If you install the 1.8.6 library, it should still work
  despite of these test failures.  If you want the working copy without any
  test failure, you can request it from us.  SLU - 2011/01/26 

* If parallel gmake (e.g., gmake -j 4) is used, the "gmake clean" command
  sometimes fails in the perform directory due to the attempt to remove the
  executable of h5perf or h5perf_serial by two "parallel" commands. This error
  has no consequence on the functionality of the HDF5 library or install. It
  is fixed in the next release. AKC - 2011/01/25

* While working on the 1.8.6 release of HDF5, a bug was discovered that can
  occur when reading from a dataset in parallel shortly after it has been
  written to collectively. The issue was exposed by a new test in the parallel
  HDF5 test suite, but had existed before that. We believe the problem lies with
  certain MPI implementations and/or filesystems.

  We have provided a pure MPI test program, as well as a standalone HDF5
  program, that can be used to determine if this is an issue on your system.
  They should be run across multiple nodes with a varying number of processes.
  These programs can be found at:
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/examples/known_problems/

* The h5diff tool can display garbage values when variable-length strings in 
  a compound type dataset are compared. This also occurs with variable-length 
  string arrays in a compound type dataset. See bug #1989. This will be fixed 
  in the next release. JKM - 2010/11/05

* The AIX --enable-shared setting does not quite work. It can produce a shared 
  library, but there cannot be more than one shared library that is 
  interlinked. This means that the high level APIs will not work which is not 
  very useful. We hope to have a solution in the next release. 
  (AKC - 2010/10/15)
  
* H5Eset_auto can cause a seg fault for a library API call if the application
  compiles with -DH5_USE_16_API (see bug 1707).  It will be fixed in the 
  next release. SLU - 2010/10/5
  
* The library's test dt_arith.c showed a compiler's rounding problem on 
  Cygwin when converting an unsigned long long to a long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works fine.  We defined a macro for Cygwin to 
  skip this test until we can solve the problem.  Please see bug #1813. 
  SLU - 2010/5/5
  
* All the VFL drivers aren't backwardly compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the 
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  A new parameter was added to the 
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions, and a new callback function 
  get_type_map was added. The public function H5FDrealloc was taken out in 
  1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver for 1.6 
  and try to plug in a 1.8 library. This will be fixed in 1.10. SLU - 2010/2/2

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully link
  C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. Read all of
  the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions. ADB - 2009/11/11
  
* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would 
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file does not 
  exist. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has 
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11

* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and 
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of their sub-tests. These 
  sub-tests are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but 
  the yod command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod 
  always returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell 
  expects a non-zero for this particular test. Therefore, it concludes the 
  test has failed when it receives 0 from yod.  To skip all the "failing" 
  tests for now, change them as shown below.

  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the 
  message  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery."  This interferes 
  with test suites that do not expect to see this message.  See the "Red Storm" 
  section in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem. 
  AKC - 2008/05/28
  
* On an Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use the -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level 
  of optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests.
  
* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6 on a system using four processors, if more than 
  two processes contribute no I/O and the application asks to do collective 
  I/O, we have found that a simple collective write will sometimes hang. This 
  can be verified with the t_mpi test under testpar.
  
* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 or later library cannot be 
  read with the v1.6.2 or earlier library when the Fletcher32 EDC filter 
  is enabled. There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum 
  in the library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent 
  between big-endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in 
  Release 1.6.3. However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no 
  longer the same as before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 
  1.6.4 can still read datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of 
  v1.6.2 or earlier. SLU - 2005/6/30
  
* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error 
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'. To 
  work around this, set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to 
  minimize the messages and run the tests again. The tests may fail with 
  messages like "The socket name is already in use", but HDF5 does not use 
  sockets. This failure is due to problems with the poe command trying to 
  set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, check to see whether 
  there are any old /tmp/s.pedb.* files around. These are sockets used by 
  the poe command and left behind if the command failed at some point. To 
  resolve this, ask your system administrator to remove the 
  old/tmp/s.pedb.* files, and then ask IBM to provide a means to run poe 
  without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link 
  libraries if the static version of that library is present. If only the 
  shared version of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on 
  Solaris, AIX, and Mac, for example, only have shared versions), the flag 
  should still result in a successful compilation, but note that the 
  installed executables will not be fully static. Thus, the only guarantee 
  on these systems is that the executable is statically linked with just 
  the HDF5 library.
  
* On an SGI Altix SMP ia64 system, the Intel compiler version 10.1 (which 
  is the default on that system) does not work properly and results in 
  failures during the make check (in a static build) and the make 
  installcheck (in a shared build). This appears to be a compiler 
  optimization problem. Reducing the optimization by setting CFLAGS to 
  -O1 or below resolves the issue. Using a newer version of the compiler 
  (11.0) avoids the issue. MAM - 2010/06/01
  
* On solaris systems, when running the examples with the scripts installed in
  .../share/hdf5_examples, two of the c tests, h5_extlink and h5_elink_unix2win 
  may fail or generate HDF5 errors because the script commands in c/run-c-ex.sh 
  fail to create test directories red, blue, and u2w.  Moving the '!' in lines 
  67, 70, 73 of run-c-ex.sh will fix the problem.  For example the script command 
  "if ! test -d red; then" will work on solaris if changed to 
  "if test ! -d red; then".

- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.4
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - CMake Early Access: This release adds support for building HDF5 using
      the CMake system. Initial work has targeted Windows, but other platforms
      can be used. See the CMake.TXT file for more information. Version
      2.8.1 of CMake is required.
    - Configure now adds appropriate defines for supporting large (64-bit)
      files on all systems, where supported, by default, instead of only Linux.
      This large file support is controllable with the --enable-largefile 
      configure option. The Linux-specific --enable-linux-lfs option has been 
      deprecated in favor of this new option. Please note that specifying
      --disable-large does NOT attempt to "turn off" largefile support if it
      is natively supported by the compiler, but rather just disables 
      configure from actively trying to add any additional compiler flags.
      (MAM - 2010/05/05 - Bug # 1772/1434)
    - Fixed an signal handling mask error in H5detect that might result in
      SIGBUS or SIGSEGV failures in some platforms such as Linux on Sparc.
      (AKC - 2010/4/28 - Bug # 1764)
    - Fixed various "strict aliasing" problems, allowing higher levels
      of compiler optimization (in particular, allowing '-O3' to work
      with recent versions of GCC).  (QAK - 2010/04/26)
    - Upgraded versions of autotools used to generate configuration suite.
      We now use Automake 1.11.1, Autoconf 2.65, and Libtool 2.2.6b. 
      (MAM - 2010/04/15)
    - Added the xlc-* and mpcc_r-* BASENAME patterns to be recognized as IBM
      compilers so that the IBM compiler options can be added properly.  This
      allows non-system-default compiler command names (e.g. xlc-m.n.k.l) be
      recognized. (AKC - 2009/11/26)

    Library
    -------
    - Performance is substantially improved when extending a dataset with early 
      allocation. (NAF - 2010/03/24 - Bug # 1637)
    - Added support for filtering densely stored groups.  Many of the API
      functions related to filters have been extended to support dense groups
      as well as datasets.  Pipeline messages can now be stored in a group's
      object header. (NAF/QAK - 2009/11/3)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump: Added the new packed bits feature which prints packed bits stored
      in an integer dataset. (AKC/ADB - 2010/5/7) 
    - h5diff: Fixed incorrect behavior (hang) in parallel mode when specifying 
      invalid options (ex: -v and -q). (JKM - 2010/02/17)
    - h5diff: Added new flag --no-dangling-links (see --help for details).
      (JKM - 2010/02/10) 
    - h5diff: Added new flag --follow-symlinks (see --help for details).
      (JKM - 2010/01/25)
    - h5diff: Added a fix to correct the display of garbage values when 
      displaying big-endian data on a little-endian machine. (JKM - 2009/11/20)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    F90 API
    -------
    - None

    C++ API
    -------
    - New member functions
        + Overloaded CommonFG::getObjnameByIdx to take char* for name.
        + Overloaded CommonFG::getObjTypeByIdx to return type name as a char*.
          (BMR - 2010/05/10)
        + Added DataSet::getInMemDataSize() to simplify getting the dataset's
          data size in memory.  (BMR - 2009/07/26)


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - AIX 6.1 has been added. (AKC - 2010/1/4)


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.4
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Fixed various "strict aliasing" problems, allowing higher levels
      of compiler optimization (in particular, allowing '-O3' to work
      with recent versions of GCC).  (QAK - 2010/04/26)

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a file corruption bug that could happen when shrinking a compressed
      dataset. (NAF - 2010/05/20)
    - Fixed some memory leaks in VL datatype conversion when strings are
      used as fill values. (MAM - 2010/05/12 - Bug # 1826)
    - Fixed an H5Rcreate failure when passing in a -1 for the dataspace 
      identifier. (ADB - 2010/4/28)
    - Fixed a bug when copying objects with NULL references with the
      H5O_COPY_EXPAND_REFERENCE_FLAG flag set. (NAF - 2010/04/08 - Bug # 1815)
    - Added a mechanism to the H5I interface to save returned object identifier 
      structures for immediate re-use if needed. This addresses a potential 
      performance issue by delaying the case when the next identifier to be
      registered has grown so large that it wraps around and needs to be
      checked to see whether it is available for distribution.
      (MAM - 2010/03/15 - Bug # 1730)
    - Files can now be concurrently opened more than once using the core file
      driver, as long as the backing store is used. (NAF - 2010/03/09)
    - Added support for H5O_COPY_EXPAND_EXT_LINK_FLAG to H5Ocopy.  External
      links will now be expanded if this flag is set.
      (NAF - 2010/03/05 - Bug # 1733)
    - Fixed a bug where the library, when traversing an external link, would
      reopen the source file if nothing else worked. (NAF - 2010/03/05)
    - Fixed a bug where fractal heap identifiers for attributes and shared 
      object header messages could be incorrectly encoded in the file for 
      files created on big-endian platforms.  
      Please see http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/known_problems if you 
      suspect you have a file with this problem.  
      (QAK - 2010/02/23 - Bug # 1755)
    - Fixed an intermittent bug in the b-tree code which could be triggered
      by expanding and shrinking chunked datasets in certain ways.
      (NAF - 2010/02/16)
    - H5Tdetect_class said a VL string is a string type.  But when it's in
      a compound type, it said it's a VL type.  THis has been fixed to be 
      consistent; it now always returns a string type. 
      (SLU - 2009/12/10 - Bug # 1584)
    - Allow "child" files from external links to be correctly located when
      relative to a "parent" file that is opened through a symbolic link.
      (QAK - 2009/12/01)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Parallel mode in AIX will fail some of the testcheck_version.sh tests
      where it treats "exit(134) the same as if process 0 had received an abort
      signal.  Fixed.  (AKC - 2009/11/3)

    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed h5ls to return exit code 1 (error) when a non-existent file is
      specified. (JKM - 2010/04/27 - Bug # 1793)
    - Fixed h5copy failure when copying a dangling link that is specified 
      directly. (JKM - 2010/04/22 - Bug # 1817)
    - Fixed an h5repack failure that lost attributes from a dataset of 
      reference type. (JKM - 2010/3/25 - Bug # 1726)
    - Fixed h5repack error that set NULL for object reference values for
      datasets, groups, or named datatypes. (JKM - 2010/03/19 - Bug # 1814)

    F90 API
    ------
    - None 

    C++ API
    ------
    - The constructor PropList::PropList(id) was fixed to act properly
      according to the nature of 'id'.  When 'id' is a property class 
      identifier, a new property list will be created.  When 'id' is a 
      property list identifier, a copy of the property list will be made. 
      (BMR - 2010/5/9)
    - The parameters 'size' and 'bufsize' in CommonFG::getLinkval and
      CommonFG::getComment, respectively, now have default values for the
      user's convenience.  (BMR - 2009/10/23)
    - NULL pointer accessing was fixed.  (BMR - 2009/10/05 - Bug # 1061)
    - Read/write methods of DataSet and Attribute classes were fixed
      to handle string correctly.  (BMR - 2009/07/26)

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Fixed a bug in H5DSattach_scale, H5DSis_attached, and H5DSdetach_scale
      caused by using the H5Tget_native_type function to determine the native
      type for reading the REFERENCE_LIST attribute. This bug was exposed
      on Mac PPC.  (EIP - 2010/05/22 - Bug # 1851) 
    - Fixed a bug in the H5DSdetach_scale function when 0 bytes were   
      allocated after the last reference to a dimension scale was removed         
      from the list of references in a VL element of the DIMENSION_LIST 
      attribute.  Modified the function to comply with the specification: 
      the DIMENSION_LIST attribute is now deleted when no dimension scales 
      are left attached.  (EIP - 2010/05/14 - Bug # 1822)

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - None

Known Problems
==============
* The library's test dt_arith.c exposed a compiler's rounding problem on
  Cygwin when converting from unsigned long long to long double.  The 
  library's own conversion works correctly.  A macro is defined for Cygwin 
  to skip this test until we can solve the problem.  (Please see bug #1813.)
  SLU - 2010/5/5 

* All the VFL drivers aren't backward compatible.  In H5FDpublic.h, the
  structure H5FD_class_t changed in 1.8.  There is a new parameter added to
  get_eoa and set_eoa callback functions.  A new callback function
  get_type_map was added.  The public function H5FDrealloc was taken
  out in 1.8.  The problem only happens when users define their own driver
  for 1.6 and try to plug it into a 1.8 library.  This affects a very small
  number of users.  (See bug report #1279.)  SLU - 2010/2/2

* MinGW has a missing libstdc++.dll.a library file and will not successfully 
  link C++ applications/tests. Do not use the enable-cxx configure option. 
  Read all of the INSTALL_MINGW.txt file for all restrictions. 
  ADB - 2009/11/11
  
* Some tests in tools/h5repack may fail in AIX systems when -q32 mode is used.
  The error is due to insufficient memory requested. Request a large amount
  of runtime memory by setting the following environment variable for more
  memory.

* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file is not
  existing. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* For gcc v4.3 and v4.4, with production mode, if -O3 is used, H5Tinit.c
  would fail to compile. Actually bad H5Tinit.c is produced.  If -O (same
  as -O1) is used, H5Tinit.c compiled okay but test/dt_arith would fail.
  When -O0 (no optimizatio) is used, H5Tinit.c compilete okay and all
  tests passed. Therefore, -O0 is imposed for v4.3 and v4.4 of gcc.
  AKC - 2009/04/20

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5

  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use,"  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac,
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On FREE-BSD systems when shared libraries are disabled, make install fails
  in install-examples with the error '"Makefile", line 635: Need an operator'.
  When this error occurs removing or commenting out the line "export
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(LL_PATH)" (line 635 in examples/Makefile) will allow make
  install to finish installing examples.  The problem will be fixed in the
  next release. LRK - 2010/05/26

* On cobalt, an SGI Altix SMP ia64 system, Intel compiler version 10.1 (which
  is the default on that system) does not work properly and results in
  failures during make check (in a static build) and make installcheck (during
  a shared build). This appears to be a compiler optimization problem.
  Reducing optimization by setting CFLAGS to -O1 or below resolves the issue.
  Alternatively, using a newer version of the compiler (11.0) also works as
  intended. MAM - 2010/06/01

- New Features
- Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
- Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.3
- Platforms Tested
- Supported Configuration Features Summary
- Known Problems


New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Configuration suite now uses Automake 1.11 and Autoconf 2.64.
      MAM 2009/08/31.
    - Changed default Gnu fortran compiler from g95 to gfortran since
      gfortran is more likely installed with gcc now. -AKC 2009/07/19- 

    Library
    -------
    - The embedded library information is displayed by H5check_version() if a
      version mismatch is detected.  Also changed H5check_version() to
      suppress the warning message totally if $HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK is 2
      or higher. (Old behavior treated 3 or higher the same as 1, that is
      print a warning and allows the program to continue. (AKC - 2009/9/28)
    - If a user does not care for the extra library information insert
      in the executables, he may turn it off by --disable-embedded-libinfo
      during configure. (AKC - 2009/9/15)

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff: h5diff treats two INFINITY values different. Fixed by checking
      (value==expect) before call ABS(...) at h5diff_array.c. This will make 
      that (INF==INF) is true (INF is treated as an number instead of NaN) 
      (PC -- 2009/07/28)
    - h5diff: add option "--use-system-epsilon" to print difference if 
      (|a-b| > EPSILON).
      Change default to use strict equality (PC -- 2009/09/12)

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - None

    F90 API
    -------
     - Added H5Oopen_by_addr_f MSB - 9/14/09

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - PathScale compilers are recognized and can build the HDF5 library
      properly. AKC - 2009/7/28 -


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.3
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Removed the following config files, as we no longer support them:
        config/dec-osf*, config/hpux11.00, config/irix5.x, 
        config/powerpc-ibm-aix4.x config/rs6000-ibm-aix5.x config/unicos*
      MAM - 2009/10/08
    - Modified configure and make process to properly preserve user's CFLAGS
      (and company) environment variables. Build will now properly use
      automake's AM_CFLAGS for any compiler flags set by the configure
      process. Configure will no longer modify CFLAGS directly, nor will 
      setting CFLAGS during make completely replace what configure has set up.
      MAM - 2009/10/08
    - Support for TFLOPS, config/intel-osf1, is removed since the TFLOPS
      machine has long retired. AKC - 2009/10/06.
    - Added $(EXEEXT) extension to H5detect when it's executed in the
      src/Makefile to generate H5Tinit.c so it works correctly on platforms 
      that require the full extension when running executables.
      MAM - 2009/10/01 - BZ #1613
    - Configure will now set FC and CXX to "no" when fortran and c++
      are not being compiled, respectively, so configure will not run
      some of the compiler tests for these languages when they are not 
      being used. MAM - 2009/10/01
    - The --enable-static-exec flag will now properly place the -static flag
      on the link line of all installed executables. This will force the 
      executable to link with static libraries over shared libraries, provided
      the static libraries are available. MAM - 2009/08/31 - BZ #1583
    - The PathScale compiler (v3.2) was mistaken as gcc v4.2.0 but it fails to
      recognize some gcc options. Fixed. (see bug 1301). AKC - 2009/7/28 -

    Library
    -------
    - Fixed a bug where writing and deleting many global heap objects (i.e.
      variable length data) would render the file unreadable.  Previously
      created files exhibiting this problem should now be readable.
      NAF - 2009/10/27 - 1483
    - Fixed error in library's internal caching mechanisms which could cause
      an assertion failure (and attendent core dump) when encountering an
      unusually formatted file.  (QAK - 2009/10/13)
    - Fixed incorrect return value for H5Pget_preserve. AKC - 2009/10/08 - 1628
    - Fixed an assertion failure that occurred when H5Ocopy was called on a
      dataset using a vlen inside a compound. NAF - 2009/10/02 - 1597
    - Fixed incorrect return value for H5Pget_filter_by_id1/2 in H5Ppublic.h.
      NAF - 2009/09/25 - 1620
    - Fixed a bug where properties weren't being compared with the registered
      compare callback. NAF - 2009/09/25 - 1555
    - Corrected problem where library would re-write the superblock in a file
      opened for R/W access, even when no changes were made to the file.
      (QAK - 2009/08/20, Bz#1473)
    - Fixed a bug where H5Pget_filter_by_id would succeed when called for a
      filter that wasn't present. NAF - 2009/06/25 - 1250
    - Fixed an issue with committed compound datatypes containing a vlen. Also
      fixed memory leaks involving committed datatypes. NAF - 2009/06/10 - 1593

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - h5dump/h5ls display buffer resize fixed in tools library.
      ADB - 2009/7/21 - 1520
    - perf_serial test added to Windows projects and check batch file. 
      ADB - 2009/06/11 -1504


    F90 API
    ------
    - Fixed bug in h5lget_info_by_idx_f by adding missing arguments, 
      consequently changing the API. New API is:

      SUBROUTINE h5lget_info_by_idx_f(loc_id, group_name, index_field, order, n, &
        link_type, f_corder_valid, corder, cset, address, val_size, hdferr, lapl_id)

        MSB - 2009/9/17 - 1652

    - Corrected the values for the H5L_flags FORTRAN constants: 
        H5L_LINK_ERROR_F, H5L_LINK_HARD_F, H5L_LINK_SOFT_F, H5L_LINK_EXTERNAL_F
        MSB - 2009-09-17 - 1653

    - Added FORTRAN equivalent of C constant H5T_ORDER_NONE: H5T_ORDER_NONE_F
        MSB - 2009-9-24 - 1471

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Fixed a bug where the H5TB API would forget the order of fields when added
      out of offset order. NAF - 2009/10/27 - 1582
    - H5DSis_attached failed to account for different platform types. Added a
      get native type call. ADB - 2009/9/29 - 1562

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Lite: the h5ltread_dataset_string_f and h5ltget_attribute_string_f functions 
           had memory problems with the g95 fortran compiler. (PVN � 5/13/2009) 1522

Known Problems
==============
* Parallel mode in AIX will fail some of the testcheck_version.sh tests where
  it treats "exit(134) the same as if process 0 had received an abort signal.
  This is fixed and will be available in the next release. AKC - 2009/11/3

* Some tests in tools/h5repack may fail in AIX systems when -q32 mode is used.
  The error is due to insufficient memory requested. Request a large amount
  of runtime memory by setting the following environment variable for more
  memory.
     LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x20000000@DSA
  AKC - 2009/10/31

* The PathScale MPI implementation, accessing a Panasas file system, would
  cause H5Fcreate() with H5F_ACC_EXCL to fail even when the file is not
  existing. This is due to the MPI_File_open() call failing if the amode has
  the MPI_MODE_EXCL bit set. (See bug 1468 for details.) AKC - 2009/8/11
 
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* There is a known issue in which HDF5 will change the timestamp on a file 
  simply by opening it with read/write permissions, even if the file is not
  modified in any way. This is due to the way in which HDF5 manages the file 
  superblock. A fix is currently underway and should be included in the 1.8.4
  release of HDF5. MAM - 2009/04/28

* For gcc v4.3 and v4.4, with production mode, if -O3 is used, H5Tinit.c
  would fail to compile. Actually bad H5Tinit.c is produced.  If -O (same
  as -O1) is used, H5Tinit.c compiled okay but test/dt_arith would fail.
  When -O0 (no optimizatio) is used, H5Tinit.c compilete okay and all
  tests passed. Therefore, -O0 is imposed for v4.3 and v4.4 of gcc.
  AKC - 2009/04/20

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ==================================================

  ======== Original tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh =========
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag will only statically link libraries
  if the static version of that library is present. If only the shared version
  of a library exists (i.e., most system libraries on Solaris, AIX, and Mac, 
  for example, only have shared versions), the flag should still result in a 
  successful compilation, but note that the installed executables will not be 
  fully static. Thus, the only guarantee on these systems is that the 
  executable is statically linked with just the HDF5 library.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

New Features
============

    Configuration
    -------------
    - Added libtool version numbers to generated c++, fortran, and 
      hl libraries. MAM 2009/04/19.
    - Regenerated Makefile.ins using Automake 1.10.2. MAM 2009/04/19.
    - Added a Make target of check-all-install to test the correctness of
      installing via the prefix= or $DESTDIR options. AKC - 2009/04/14

    Library
    -------
    - Embed the content of libhdf5.settings into the hdf5 executables
      so that an "orphaned" executables can display (via the Unix
      strings command, for example) the library settings used to build
      the executables.  This is a prototype implementation. Improvement will
      be added in next release.  AKC - 2009/04/20
    - Separated "factory" free list class from block free lists. These free
      lists are dynamically created and manage blocks of a fixed size.
      H5set_free_list_limits() will use the same settings specified for block
      free lists for factory free lists. NAF - 2009/04/08
    - Added support for dense attributes to H5Ocopy. XCao/NAF - 2009/01/29
    - Added H5Pset_elink_cb and H5Pget_elink_cb functions to support a
      user-defined callback function for external link traversal.
      NAF - 2009/01/08
    - Added H5Pset_elink_acc_flags and H5Pget_elink_acc_flags functions to
      allow the user to specify the file access flags used to open the target
      file of an external link. NAF - 2009/01/08
    - Added H5Pset_chunk_cache() and H5Pget_chunk_cache() functions to allow
      individual rdcc configuration for each dataset.  Added
      H5Dget_access_plist() function to retrieve a dataset access property
      list from a dataset. NAF - 2008/11/12
    - Added H5Iis_valid() function to check if an id is valid without
      producing an error message. NAF - 2008/11/5
    - Added code to maintain a min_clean_fraction in the metadata cache when
      in serial mode. MAM - 2009/01/9

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - Modified parallel tests to run with arbitrary number of processes. The
      modified tests are testphdf5 (parallel dataset access), t_chunk_alloc
      (chunk allocation), and t_posix_compliant (posix compliance). The rest of
      the parallel tests already use in the code the number of processes
      available in the communicator. (CMC - 2009/04/28)
 
    Tools
    -----
    - h5diff new flag, -c, --compare, list objects that are not comparable.
      PVN - 2009/4/2 - 1368
    - h5diff new flag, -N, --nan, avoids NaNs detection. PVN - 2009/4/2
    - h5dump correctly specifies XML dtd / schema urls ADB - 2009/4/3 - 1519
    - h5repack now handles group creation order. PVN - 2009/4/2 - 1402
    - h5repack: When user doesn't specify a chunk size, h5repack now 
      defines a default chunk size as the same size of the size of the 
      hyperslab used to read the chunks. The size of the hyperslabs are 
      defined as the size of each dimension or a predefined constant, 
      whatever is smaller. This assures that the chunk read fits in the 
      chunk cache. PVN - 2008/11/21

    High-Level APIs
    ---------------
    - Table: In version 3.0 of Table, the writing of the "NROWS" attribute 
      (used to store number of records) was deprecated. PVN - 2008/11/24

    F90 API
    -------
    - Added for the C APIs the Fortran wrappers:
          h5dget_access_plist_f
          h5iis_valid_f
          h5pset_chunk_cache_f
          h5pget_chunk_cache_f
      MSB - 2009/04/17

    C++ API
    -------
    - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.2
==========================

    Configuration
    -------------
    - The --includedir=DIR configuration option now works as intended, and 
      can be used to specify the location to install C header files. The
      default location remains unchanged, residing at ${prefix}/include.
      MAM - 2009/03/10 - BZ #1381
    - Configure no longer removes the '-g' flag from CFLAGS when in production
      mode if it has been explicitly set in the CFLAGS environment variable 
      prior to configuration. MAM - 2009/03/09 - BZ #1401

    Library
    -------
    - Added versioning to H5Z_class_t struct to allow compatibility with 1.6
      API. NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1533
    - Fixed a problem with using data transforms with non-native types in the
      file. NAF - 2009/04/20 - 1548
    - Added direct.h include file to windows section of H5private.h 
      to fix _getcwd() warning. ADB - 2009/04/14 - 1536
    - Fixed a bug that prevented external links from working after calling
      H5close(). NAF - 2009/04/10 - 1539
    - Modified library to write cached symbol table information to the
      superblock, to allow library versions 1.3.0 to 1.6.3 to read files created
      by this version. NAF - 2009/04/08 - 1423
    - Changed skip lists to use a deterministic algorithm.  The library should
      now never call rand() or srand(). NAF - 2009/04/08 - 503
    - Fixed a bug where H5Lcopy and H5Lmove wouldn't create intermediate groups
      when that property was set. NAF - 2009/04/07 - 1526
    - Fixed a bug that caused files with a user block to grow by the size of the
      user block every time they were opened. NAF - 2009/03/26 - 1499
    - Fixed a rare problem that could occur with files using the old (pre 1.4)
      array datatype. NAF - 2009/03/23
    - Modified library to be able to open files with corrupt root group symbol
      table messages, and correct these errors if they are found.  Such files
      can only be successfully opened with write access. NAF - 2009/03/23 - 1189
    - Removed the long_long #define and replaced all instances with 
      "long long". This caused problems with third party products. All 
      currently supported compliers support the type. ADB - 2009/03/05
    - Fixed various bugs that could prevent the fill value from being written
      in certain rare cases. NAF - 2009/02/26 - 1469
    - Fixed a bug that prevented more than one dataset chunk from being cached
      at a time. NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1015
    - Fixed an assertion failure caused by opening an attribute multiple times
      through multiple file handles. NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1420
    - Fixed a problem that could prevent the user from adding attributes (or any
      object header message) in some circumstances. NAF - 2009/02/12 - 1427
    - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when an attribute was added to a
      committed datatype using the committed datatype's datatype.
      NAF - 2009/02/12
    - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when copying an object with a shared
      message in its own object header. NAF - 2009/01/29
    - Changed H5Tset_order to properly reject H5T_ORDER_NONE for most datatypes.
      NAF - 2009/01/27 - 1443
    - Fixed a bug where H5Tpack wouldn't remove trailing space from an otherwise
      packed compound type. NAF - 2009/01/14
    - Fixed up some old v2 btree assertions that get run in debug mode that
      were previously failing on compilation, and removed some of the 
      more heavily outdated and non-rewritable ones. MAM - 2008/12/15
    - Fixed a bug that could cause problems when "automatically" unmounting
      multiple files. NAF - 2008/11/17
    - H5Dset_extent: when shrinking dimensions, some chunks were not deleted.  
      PVN - 2009/01/8 

    Parallel Library
    ----------------
    - None

    Tools
    -----
    - Fixed many problems that could occur when using h5repack with named
      datatypes. NAF - 2009/4/20 - 1516/1466
    - h5dump, h5diff, h5repack were not reading (by hyperslabs) datasets 
      that have a datatype datum size greater than H5TOOLS_BUFSIZE, a constant
      defined as 1024Kb, such as array types with large dimensions. 
      PVN - 2009/4/1 - 1501
    - h5import: By selecting a compression type, a big endian byte order 
      was being selected. PVN - 2009/3/11 - 1462
    - zip_perf.c had missing argument on one of the open() calls. Fixed.
      AKC - 2008/12/9

    F90 API
    ------
    - None

    C++ API
    ------
    - None

    High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Dimension scales: The scale index return value in H5DSiterate_scales 
      was not always incremented. PVN - 2009/4/8 - 1538

    Fortran High-Level APIs:
    ------
    - Lite: The h5ltget_dataset_info_f function (gets information about 
      a dataset) was not correctly returning the dimension array 
                                   PVN - 2009/3/23

Known Problems
==============
* Parallel tests failed with 16 processes with data inconsistency at testphdf5
  / dataset_readAll. Parallel tests also failed with 32 and 64 processes with
  collective abort of all ranks at t_posix_compliant / allwrite_allread_blocks
  with MPI IO. CMC - 2009/04/28

* There is a known issue in which HDF5 will change the timestamp on a file 
  simply by opening it with read/write permissions, even if the file is not
  modified in any way. This is due to the way in which HDF5 manages the file 
  superblock. A fix is currently underway and should be included in the 1.8.4
  release of HDF5. MAM - 2009/04/28

* For gcc v4.3 and v4.4, with production mode, if -O3 is used, H5Tinit.c
  would fail to compile. Actually bad H5Tinit.c is produced.  If -O (same
  as -O1) is used, H5Tinit.c compiled okay but test/dt_arith would fail.
  When -O0 (no optimizatio) is used, H5Tinit.c compilete okay and all
  tests passed. Therefore, -O0 is imposed for v4.3 and v4.4 of gcc.
  AKC - 2009/04/20

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ==================================================

  ======== Original tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh =========
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ======== Change to ===============================
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d grp_rename
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -v -s grp_dsets  -d /grp_rename/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_dsets -d /E/F/grp_dsets
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST_FAIL -i $TESTFILE -o $FILEOUT -vp -s /grp_nested -d /G/H/grp_nested
  echo SKIP H5LSTEST $FILEOUT
  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);
  KY - 2007/08/24

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platforms for serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

New Features
============

        Configuration
        -------------
        - Upgraded libtool to version 2.2.6a. (MAM - 2008/10/15).

        Library
        -------
	- Added two new public routines: H5Pget_elink_fapl() and
      	  H5Pset_elink_fapl(). (see bug #1247) (VC - 2008/10/13)
        - Improved free space tracking in file to be faster. (QAK - 2008/10/06)
        - Added 'mounted' field to H5G_info_t struct. (QAK - 2008/07/15)

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - h5repack: added new options -u and -b to add a userblock to an HDF5 
          file during the repack.  (PVN - 2008/08/26)
        - h5repack: added options -t and -a to call H5Pset_alignment while 
          creating a repacked file. (PVN - 2008/08/29)
        - h5ls: added capability to traverse through external links when the -r
          (recursive) flag is given. (NAF - 2008/09/16)
        - h5ls: added -E option to enable traversal of external links.  
          h5ls will not traverse external links without this flag being set.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
        - h5dump: when -b flag is used without a keyword after it, binary 
          output defaults to NATIVE. MEMORY keyword was deprecated 
          and replaced by NATIVE keyword. (PVN - 2008/10/30)
        - h5diff: returns 1 when file graphs differ by any object.  
          Error return code was changed to 2 from -1.  (PVN - 2008/10/30)
        - h5import: TEXTFPE (scientific format) was deprecated. Use TEXTFP 
          instead (PVN - 2008/10/30)



        F90 API
        ------
         - Added optional parameter 'mounted' to H5Gget_info_f, 
           H5Gget_info_by_idx_f, H5Gget_info_by_name_f (MSB - 2008/09/24)
	 - Added H5Tget_native_type_f (MSB - 2008/09/30)
	 
	 
        C++ API
        ------
        - These member functions were added as wrapper for H5Rdereference to
          replace the incorrect IdComponent::dereference().
             void H5Object::dereference(H5Object& obj, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             void H5Object::dereference(H5File& h5file, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             void H5Object::dereference(Attribute& obj, void* ref, 
                                        H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)

          In addition, these constructors were added to create the associated
          objects by way of dereference:
             DataSet(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataSet(H5File& file, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataSet(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             Group(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             Group(H5File& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             Group(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataType(H5Object& obj, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataType(H5File& file, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
             DataType(Attribute& attr, void* ref, H5R_type_t ref_type=H5R_OBJECT)
          (BMR - 2008/10/29)


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
        - Intel 10.1 is supported on Mac OS X 10.5.4.
          Note:
          When Fortran is enabled, configure automatically
          disables the build of shared libraries (i.e., only
          static C and C++ HDF5 libraries will be built
          along with the static HDF5 Fortran library).
          Intel 10.1 C and C++ compilers require 
          "-no-multibyte-chars" compilation flag due to the known
          bug in the compilers.
            (EIP - 2008/10/30)


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.1 
==========================

        Configuration
        -------------
        - Fixed error with 'make check install' failing due to h5dump
          needing other tools built first. (MAM - 2008/10/15).
        - When using shared szip, it is no longer necessary to specify
          the path to the shared szip libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
           (MAM - 2008/10/15).
	- The file libhdf5_fortran.settings is not installed since its content
	  is included in libhdf5.settings now. (AKC - 2008/10/21)
        - "make DESTDIR=xxx install" failed to install some tools and files
          (e.g., h5cc and fortran modules). Fixed. (AKC - 2008/10/8).

        Library
        -------
        - H5Ovisit and H5Ovisit_by_name will now properly terminate when the
            callback function returns a positive value on the starting object.
            (NAF - 2008/11/03)
        - Fixed an error where a null message could be created that was larger
            than could be written to the file.  (NAF - 2008/10/23)
        - Corrected error with family/split/multi VFD not updating driver info
            when "latest" version of the file format used. (QAK - 2008/10/14)
        - Corrected alignment+threshold errors to work correctly when metadata
            aggregation is enabled. (QAK - 2008/10/06)
        - Changed H5Fget_obj_count and H5Fget_obj_ids to ignore objects
            registered by the library for internal library use.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
        - Fixed potential memory leak during compound conversion.
            (NAF - 2008/10/06)
        - Changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_count from INT to SSIZE_T. 
            Also changed the return value of H5Fget_obj_ids from HERR_T to 
            SSIZE_T and the type of the parameter MAX_OBJS from INT to SIZE_T. 
            (SLU - 2008/09/26)
        - Fixed an issue that could cause data to be improperly overwritten
            during compound type conversion.  (NAF - 2008/09/19)
        - Fixed pointer alignment violations that could occur during vlen
            conversion.  (NAF - 2008/09/16)
        - Fixed problem where library could cause a segmentation fault when
            an invalid location ID was given to H5Giterate(). (QAK - 2008/08/19)
        - Fixed improper shutdown when objects have reference count > 1.  The
            library now tracks reference count due to the application separately
            from that due to internal library routines.  (NAF - 2008/08/19)
        - Fixed assertion failure caused by incorrect array datatype version.
            (NAF - 2008/08/08)
        - Fixed an issue where mount point traversal would fail when using
            multiple handles for the child.  (NAF - 2008/08/07)
        - Fixed an issue where mount points were inaccessible when using 
            multiple file handles for the parent. The mount table is now in 
            the shared file structure (the parent pointer is still in the 
            top structure).  (NAF - 2008/08/07)
        - Fixed assertion failure caused by incorrect array datatype version.
            (NAF - 2008/08/04)
        - Fixed issue where a group could have a file mounted on it twice.
            (QAK - 2008/07/15)
        - When an attribute was opened twice and data was written with 
            one of the handles, the file didn't have the data. It happened 
            because each handle had its own object structure, and the empty 
            one overwrote the data with fill value.  This is fixed by making 
            some attribute information like the data be shared in the 
            attribute structure.  (SLU - 2008/07/07)
        - Fixed a Windows-specific issue in the ohdr test which was causing 
            users in some timezones to get false errors. This a deficiency in 
            the Windows mktime() function, and has been handled properly.  
            (SJW  - 2008/06/19)

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - h5dump now checks for uniqueness of committed datatypes.
            (NAF - 2008/10/15)
        - Fixed unnecessary indentation of committed datatypes in h5dump.
            (NAF - 2008/10/15)
	- Fixed bugs in h5stat: segmemtation fault when printing groups and
          print warning message when traversal of objects is unsuccessful.
          (see bug #1253) (VC- 2008/10/13)
        - Fixed bug in h5ls that prevented relative group listings (like
            "h5ls foo.h5/bar") from working correctly (QAK - 2008/06/03)
        - h5dump: when doing binary output (-b), the stdout printing of 
             attributes was done incorrectly. Removed printing of attributes 
             when doing binary output. (PVN - 2008/06/05)


        F90 API
        ------
        - h5sselect_elements_f: Added additional operators H5S_SELECT_APPEND 
            and H5S_SELECT_PREPEND (MSB - 2008/09/30)
	- h5sget_select_elem_pointlist: Fixed list of returned points by 
            rearranging the point list correctly by accounting for C 
            conventions. (MSB - 2008/09/30)
        - h5sget_select_hyper_blocklist_f: Fixed error in transposed dimension 
            of arrays.(MSB - 2008/9/30)
        - h5sget_select_bounds_f: Swapped array bounds to account for C and 
            Fortran reversed array notation (MSB - 2008/9/30)
	- Changed to initializing string to a blank character instead of a 
            null type in tH5P.f90 to fix compiling error using AIX 5.3.0 
            (MSB - 2008/7/29)
        - Fixed missing commas in H5test_kind.f90 detected by NAG compiler 
            (MSB - 2008/7/29)
        - Fixed passing and array to a scalar in tH5A_1_8.f90 detected by 
            NAG compiler (MSB - 2008/7/29)
	- Added the ability of the test programs to use the status of 
            HDF5_NOCLEANUP to determine if the *.h5 files should be removed 
            or not after the tests are completed (MSB - 2008/10/1)
	- In nh5tget_offset_c: (MSB 9/12/2008)
           If offset was equal to 0 it returned the error code of -1, 
           this was changed to return an error code of -1 when the offset 
           value is < 0.
        - Uses intrinsic Fortran function SIZEOF if available when detecting 
           type of INTEGERs and REALs in H5test_kind.f90 (MSB - 2008/9/3)
        - Put the DOUBLE PRECISION interfaces in a separate module and 
           added a USE statement for the module. The interfaces are 
           included/excluded depending on the state of FORTRAN_DEFAULT_REAL
           is DBLE_F which detects if the default REAL is DOUBLE PRECISION.
           This allows the library to be compiled with -r8 Fortran flag 
           without the user needing to edit the source code. 
           (MSB - 200/8/27)
        - Enable building shared library for fortran by adding the flag -fPIC 
          to the compile flags for versions of Intel Fortran compiler >=9
           (MSB  - 2008/8/26)

        C++ API
        ------
        - Fixed a design bug which allowed an Attribute object to create/modify
          attributes (bugzilla #1068).  The API class hierarchy was revised
          to address the problem.  Classes AbstractDS and Attribute are moved
          out of H5Object.  Class Attribute now multiply inherits from
          IdComponent and AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and
          AbstractDs.  In addition, the data member IdComponent::id was
          moved into subclasses: Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType,
          H5File, Group, and PropList. (BMR - 2008/05/20)
        - IdComponent::dereference was incorrect and replaced as described
          in "New Features" section.

Known Problems
==============
* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh and
  tools/h5copy/testh5copy.sh will fail some of its sub-tests. These sub-tests
  are expected to fail and should exit with a non-zero code but the yod
  command does not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always
  returns 0 if it can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects
  a non-zero for this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has
  failed when it receives 0 from yod.  Skip all the "failing" test for now
  by changing them as following.

  ======== Original tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh =========
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5

  ==================================================
  AKC - 2008/11/10

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platforms for serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

New Features
============

        Configuration
        -------------
        - The lib/libhdf5.settings file contains much more configure
          information. (AKC - 2008/05/18)

        - The new configure option "--disable-sharedlib-rpath" disables 
          embedding the '-Wl,-rpath' information into executables when 
          shared libraries are produced, and instead solely relies on the 
          information in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (MAM - 2008/05/15)

        - Configuration suite now uses Autoconf 2.61, Automake 1.10.1, and 
          Libtool 2.2.2 (MAM - 2008/05/01)

        Source code distribution
        ========================

        Library
        -------
        - None

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - h5repack: Reinstated the -i and -o command line flags to specify 
          input and output files.  h5repack now understands both the old
          syntax (with -i and -o) and the new syntax introduced in Release
          1.8.0.  (PVN - 2008/05/23)
        - h5dump: Added support for external links, displaying the object that 
          an external link points to. (PVN - 2008/05/12)
        - h5dump: Added an option, -m, to allow user-defined formatting in the 
          output of floating point numbers. (PVN - 2008/05/06)
        - h5dump, in output of the -p option: Added effective data compression 
          ratio to the dataset storage layout output when a compression filter 
          has been applied to a dataset.  (PVN - 2008/05/01)

        F90 API
        ------
        New H5A, H5G, H5L, H5O, and H5P APIs to enable 1.8 features were
        added. See "Release 1.8.1 (current release) versus Release 1.8.0" in 
        the document "HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release"
        (http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html) for the 
        complete list of the new APIs.

        C++ API
        ------
        - None


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
        - Both serial and parallel HDF5 are supported for the Red Storm machine 
          which is a Cray XT3 system.

        - The Fortran library will work correctly if compiled with the -i8 
          flag.  This has been tested with the g95, PGI and Intel Fortran 
          compilers.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.8.0 
==========================

        Configuration
        -------------
        - None

        Source code distribution
        ========================

        Library
        -------
        - Chunking:  Chunks greater than 4GB are disallowed. 
          (QAK - 2008/05/16)
        - Fixed the problem with searching for a target file when following 
          an external link.  The search pattern will depend on whether the 
          target file's pathname is an absolute or a relative path. 
          Please see the H5Lcreate_external description in the "HDF5 
          Reference Manual" (http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/RM_H5L.html).
          (VC - 2008/04/08)
        - Fixed possible file corruption bug when encoding datatype
          descriptions for compound datatypes whose size was between
          256 and 511 bytes and the file was opened with the "use the
          latest format" property enabled (with H5Pset_libver_bounds).
          (QAK - 2008/03/13)
        - Fixed bug in H5Aget_num_attrs() routine to correctly handle an 
          invalid location identifier.  (QAK - 2008/03/11)

        Parallel Library
        ----------------
        - None

        Tools
        -----
        - Fixed bug in h5diff that prevented datasets and attributes with
          variable-length string elements from comparing correctly.
          (QAK - 2008/02/28)
        - Fixed bug in h5dump that caused binary output to be made only for 
          the first dataset, when several datasets were requested.
          (PVN - 2008/04/07)

        F90 API
        ------
        - The h5tset(get)_fields subroutines were missing the parameter to 
          specify a sign position; fixed.  (EIP - 2008/05/23)
        - Many APIs were fixed to work with the 8-byte integers in Fortran vs.
          4-byte integers in C. This change is trasparent to user applications.

        C++ API
        ------
        - The class hierarchy was revised to address the problem reported
          in bugzilla #1068, Attribute should not be derived from base
          class H5Object.  Classes AbstractDS was moved out of H5Object.
          Class Attribute now multiply inherits from IdComponent and
          AbstractDs and class DataSet from H5Object and AbstractDs.
          In addition, data member IdComponent::id was moved into subclasses:
          Attribute, DataSet, DataSpace, DataType, H5File, Group, and PropList.
          (BMR - 2008/05/20)
	- IdComponent::dereference was incorrect; it was changed from:
		void IdComponent::dereference(IdComponent& obj, void* ref)
	  to:
		void H5Object::dereference(H5File& h5file, void* ref)
		void H5Object::dereference(H5Object& obj, void* ref)
	  (BMR - 2008/05/20)
        - Revised Attribute::write and Attribute::read wrappers to handle
          memory allocation/deallocation properly. (bugzilla 1045)
          (BMR - 2008/05/20)

Known Problems
==============
* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the yod command sometimes gives the
  message,  "yod allocation delayed for node recovery".  This interferes with
  test suites that do not expect seeing this message.  See the section of "Red
  Storm" in file INSTALL_parallel for a way to deal with this problem.
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* For Red Storm, a Cray XT3 system, the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh will fail on
  the test "Testing h5ls -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5" fails.  This test is
  expected to fail and exit with a non-zero code but the yod command does
  not propagate the exit code of the executables. Yod always returns 0 if it
  can launch the executable.  The test suite shell expects a non-zero for
  this particular test, therefore it concludes the test has failed when it
  receives 0 from yod.  To bypass this problem for now, change the following
  lines in the tools/h5ls/testh5ls.sh.
  ======== Original =========
  # The following combination of arguments is expected to return an error message
  # and return value 1
  TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== Skip the test =========
  echo SKIP TOOLTEST tgroup-1.ls 1 -w80 -r -g tgroup.h5
  ======== end of bypass ========
  AKC - 2008/05/28

* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);
  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* For SNL, spirit/liberty/thunderbird: The serial tests pass but parallel
  tests failed with MPI-IO file locking message. AKC - 2007/6/25

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* Configuring with --enable-debug=all produces compiler errors on most
  platforms:  Users who want to run HDF5 in debug mode should use
  --enable-debug rather than --enable-debug=all to enable debugging
  information on most modules.

* On Mac OS 10.4, test/dt_arith.c has some errors in conversion from long
  double to (unsigned) long long and from (unsigned) long long to long double. 

* On Altix SGI with Intel 9.0, testmeta.c would not compile with -O3
  optimization flag.

* On VAX, the Scaleoffset filter is not supported.  The Scaleoffset filter 
  supports only the IEEE standard for floating-point data; it cannot be applied 
  to HDF5 data generated on VAX. 

* On Cray X1, a lone colon on the command line of h5dump --xml (as in
  the testh5dumpxml.sh script) is misinterpereted by the operating system
  and causes an error.

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculation of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on the AMD 
  Opteron processor, there is a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  
  The library failed in several tests, all related to the MULTI driver.  
  The problem has been reported to the vendor.  

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platforms for serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

* The ./dsets tests fail on the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The HDF5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Not all platforms behave correctly with Szip's shared libraries. Szip is
  disabled in these cases, and a message is relayed at configure time. Static
  libraries should be working on all systems that support Szip and should be
  used when shared libraries are unavailable. 

  There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build the HDF5 
  Fortran library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 
  and fflush2.f90 complaining about the exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error).

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run 
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as 
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.  

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to 
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after 
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it 
  for your installation.  

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item 
  on the command line which executes the the test.  The script then 
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scipts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the 
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to 
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can 
  prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

* H5Ocopy() does not copy reg_ref attributes correctly when shared-message
  is turn on. The value of the reference in the destination attriubte is
  wrong. This H5Ocopy problem will affect the h5copy tool.

* In the C++ API, it appears that there are bugs in Attribute::write/read
  and DataSet::write/read for fixed- and variable-len strings.  The problems
  are being worked on and a patch will be provided when the fixes are
  available.

New Features
============

   HDF5 Release 1.8.0 is a major release with many changes and new features.

   New format and interface features discussed in the "What's New in 
   HDF5 1.8.0" document include the following:

       Enhanced group object management
       Enhanced attribute management and more efficient meta data handling
       Expanded datatype features
       Creation order tracking and indexing
       Improved meta data caching and cache control
       UTF-8 encoding
       New I/O filters: n-bit and scale+offset compression
       New link (H5L) and object (H5O) interfaces and features
       External and user-defined links
       New high-level APIs: 
           HDF5 Packet Table (H5PT) and HDF5 Dimension Scale (H5DS)
       C++ and Fortran interfaces for older high-level APIs:
           H5Lite (H5LT), H5Image (H5IM), and H5Table (H5TB)
       New and improved tools
       And more...

       http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/WhatsNew180.html


    New APIs associated with these features, other interface changes 
    (e.g., ENUM and struct definitions), and new library configuration flags
    are listed in the "Release 1.8.0 (current release) versus Release 1.6.x" 
    section of "HDF5 Software Changes from Release to Release."

        http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/ADGuide/Changes.html

Compatibility
-------------
    Many HDF5 users and user communities have existing applications that 
    they may wish to port to Release 1.8.0.  Alternatively, some users may 
    wish to take advantage of Release 1.8.0's improved performance without
    having to port such applications.  To facilitate managing application
    compatibility and porting applications from release to release, the HDF 
    Team has implemented the following features:
        Individually-configurable macros that selectively map common 
            interface names to the old and new interfaces
        Library configuration options to configure the macro mappings

    Two related documents accompany this release:
        "API Compatibility Macros in HDF5" discusses the specifics of the 
        new individually-configurable macros and library configuration 
        options.
        http://hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/RM/APICompatMacros.html
 
        "New Features in HDF5 Release 1.8.0 and Backward/Forward Format
        Compatibility Issues" discusses each new feature with regard to 
        its impact on format compatibility.

Removed Feature
===============
The stream virtual file driver (H5FD_STREAM) have been removed in this 
release. This affects the functions H5Pset_fapl_stream and H5Pget_fapl_stream 
and the constant H5FD_STREAM.

This virtual file driver will be available at 
http://hdf5-addons.origo.ethz.ch/. Note that at the time of this release, 
the transition is still in progress; the necessary integration tools may 
not be available when HDF5 Release 1.8.0 first comes out.


Support for New Platforms, Languages, and Compilers
===================================================
    - Support for Open VMS 7.3 was added.


Bug Fixes since HDF5-1.6.0 
==========================
    This release contains numerous bug fixes. For details, see the 
    "Changes from 1.6.0 to 1.8.0-rc3" section of the HISTORY.txt file for
    this release.

Known Problems
==============
* We have discovered two problems when running collective IO parallel HDF5 
  tests with chunking storage on the ChaMPIon MPI compiler on tungsten, a 
  Linux cluster at NCSA.

  Under some complex selection cases: 
  1) MPI_Get_element returns the wrong value.
  2) MPI_Type_struct also generates the wrong derived datatype and corrupt 
     data may be generated.
  These issues arise only when turning on collective IO with chunking storage 
  with some complex selections. We have not found these problems on other 
  MPI-IO compilers. If you encounter these problems, you may use independent 
  IO instead.

  To avoid this behavior, change the following line in your code
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_COLLECTIVE);

  to
      H5Pset_dxpl_mpio(xfer_plist, H5FD_MPIO_INDEPENDENT);

  KY - 2007/08/24

* For SNL, spirit/liberty/thunderbird: The serial tests pass but parallel
  tests failed with MPI-IO file locking message. AKC - 2007/6/25

* On Intel 64 Linux cluster (RH 4, Linux 2.6.9) with Intel 10.0 compilers, 
  use -mp -O1 compilation flags to build the libraries. A higher level of 
  optimization causes failures in several HDF5 library tests. 

* For SNL, Red Storm: Only parallel HDF5 is supported.  The serial tests pass
  when run against the parallel library; the parallel tests also pass, but
  with lots of non-fatal error messages.

* For LLNL, uP: both serial and parallel tests pass.  
  Zeus: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail with a known problem in MPI.
  ubgl: Serial tests pass but parallel tests fail. 

* On SUN 5.10 C++, testing fails in the "Testing Shared Datatypes with 
  Attributes" test. 

* Configuring with --enable-debug=all produces compiler errors on most
  platforms:  Users who want to run HDF5 in debug mode should use
  --enable-debug rather than --enable-debug=all to enable debugging
  information on most modules.

* On Mac OS 10.4, test/dt_arith.c has some errors in conversion from long
  double to (unsigned) long long and from (unsigned) long long to long double. 

* On Altix SGI with Intel 9.0, testmeta.c would not compile with -O3
  optimization flag.

* On VAX, the Scaleoffset filter is not supported. The filter cannot be 
  applied to HDF5 data generated on VAX. The Scaleoffset filter only supports 
  the IEEE standard for floating-point data.

* On Cray X1, a lone colon on the command line of h5dump --xml (as in
  the testh5dumpxml.sh script) is misinterpereted by the operating system
  and causes an error.

* On mpich 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, if more than two processes contribute no IO and 
  the application asks to do collective IO, we have found that when using 4 
  processors, a simple collective write will sometimes be hung. This can be 
  verified with t_mpi test under testpar.

* On IRIX6.5, when the C compiler version is greater than 7.4, complicated
  MPI derived datatype code will work. However, the user should increase
  the value of the MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable to some appropriate value 
  to use collective irregular selection code.  For example, the current 
  parallel HDF5 test needs to raise MPI_TYPE_MAX to 200,000 to pass the test. 

* A dataset created or rewritten with a v1.6.3 library or after cannot be read 
  with the v1.6.2 library or before when the Fletcher32 EDC filter is enabled.
  There was a bug in the calculating code of the Fletcher32 checksum in the 
  library before v1.6.3; the checksum value was not consistent between big-
  endian and little-endian systems.  This bug was fixed in Release 1.6.3.  
  However, after fixing the bug, the checksum value was no longer the same as 
  before on little-endian system.  Library releases after 1.6.4 can still read 
  datasets created or rewritten with an HDF5 library of v1.6.2 or before.  
  SLU - 2005/6/30

* For version 6 (6.02 and 6.04) of the Portland Group compiler on the AMD 
  Opteron processor, there is a bug in the compiler for optimization(-O2).  
  The library failed in several tests, all related to the MULTI driver.  
  The problem has been reported to the vendor.  

* On IBM AIX systems, parallel HDF5 mode will fail some tests with error
  messages like "INFO: 0031-XXX ...".  This is from the command `poe'.
  Set the environment variable MP_INFOLEVEL to 0 to minimize the messages
  and run the tests again.

  The tests may fail with messages like "The socket name is already in use",  
  but HDF5 does not use sockets.  This failure is due to problems with the 
  poe command trying to set up the debug socket.  To resolve this problem, 
  check to see whether there are many old /tmp/s.pedb.* files staying around.  
  These are sockets used by the poe command and left behind due to failed 
  commands.  First, ask your system administrator to clean them out.  
  Lastly, request IBM to provide a means to run poe without the debug socket.

* The --enable-static-exec configure flag fails to compile for Solaris
  platforms. This is due to the fact that not all of the system libraries on 
  Solaris are available in a static format.

  The --enable-static-exec configure flag also fails to correctly compile
  on IBM SP2 platform for the serial mode. The parallel mode works fine with 
  this option.
  
  It is suggested that you do not use this option on these platforms
  during configuration.

* With the gcc 2.95.2 compiler, HDF5 uses the `-ansi' flag during
  compilation. The ANSI version of the compiler complains about not being
  able to handle the `long long' datatype with the warning:

        warning: ANSI C does not support `long long'
  
  This warning is innocuous and can be safely ignored.

* The ./dsets tests fail on the TFLOPS machine if the test program,
  dsets.c, is compiled with the -O option.  The HDF5 library still works
  correctly with the -O option.  The test program works fine if it is
  compiled with -O1 or -O0.  Only -O (same as -O2) causes the test
  program to fail.

* Not all platforms behave correctly with Szip's shared libraries. Szip is
  disabled in these cases, and a message is relayed at configure time. Static
  libraries should be working on all systems that support Szip and should be
  used when shared libraries are unavailable. 

  There is also a configure error on Altix machines that incorrectly reports 
  when a version of Szip without an encoder is being used.

* On some platforms that use Intel and Absoft compilers to build the HDF5 
  Fortran library, compilation may fail for fortranlib_test.f90, fflush1.f90 
  and fflush2.f90 complaining about the exit subroutine. Comment out the line 
  IF (total_error .ne. 0) CALL exit (total_error).

* Information about building with PGI and Intel compilers is available in
  the INSTALL file sections 4.7 and 4.8.

* On at least one system, SDSC DataStar, the scheduler (in this case
  LoadLeveler) sends job status updates to standard error when you run 
  any executable that was compiled with the parallel compilers.

  This causes problems when running "make check" on parallel builds, as 
  many of the tool tests function by saving the output from test runs,
  and comparing it to an exemplar.  

  The best solution is to reconfigure the target system so it no longer
  inserts the extra text.  However, this may not be practical.

  In such cases, one solution is to "setenv HDF5_Make_Ignore yes" prior to 
  the configure and build.  This will cause "make check" to continue after 
  detecting errors in the tool tests.  However, in the case of SDSC DataStar,
  it also leaves you with some 150 "failed" tests to examine by hand.

  A second solution is to write a script to run serial tests and filter
  out the text added by the scheduler.  A sample script used on SDSC
  DataStar is given below, but you will probably have to customize it 
  for your installation.  

  Observe that the basic idea is to insert the script as the first item 
  on the command line which executes the the test.  The script then 
  executes the test and filters out the offending text before passing
  it on.

        #!/bin/csh

        set STDOUT_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stdout
        set STDERR_FILE=~/bin/serial_filter.stderr

        rm -f $STDOUT_FILE $STDERR_FILE

        ($* > $STDOUT_FILE) >& $STDERR_FILE

        set RETURN_VALUE=$status

        cat $STDOUT_FILE

        tail +3 $STDERR_FILE

        exit $RETURN_VALUE

  You get the HDF5 make files and test scipts to execute your filter script
  by setting the environment variable "RUNSERIAL" to the full path of the 
  script prior to running configure for parallel builds.  Remember to 
  "unsetenv RUNSERIAL" before running configure for a serial build.

  Note that the RUNSERIAL environment variable exists so that we can 
  can prefix serial runs as necessary on the target system.  On DataStar,
  no prefix is necessary.  However on an MPICH system, the prefix might
  have to be set to something like "/usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun -np 1" to
  get the serial tests to run at all.

  In such cases, you will have to include the regular prefix in your
  filter script.

* H5Ocopy() does not copy reg_ref attributes correctly when shared-message
  is turn on. The value of the reference in the destination attriubte is
  wrong. This H5Ocopy problem will affect the h5copy tool.
